<section id="psychopaths">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.1. </span>Psychopaths</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1974, Ram Dass had just finished teaching a six-week
course to 1,300 students at Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. His
guru, Neem Karoli Baba Maharajji, had died a year before, and he was
feeling somewhat depressed because he had not found a new teacher.
Although many thousands of people looked up to him as their spiritual
teacher, he knew that he was not enlightened, and he longed for a
teacher he could trust. He had decided that he was going to go to India
that winter to search for a suitable teacher.</p>
<p>Hilda Charlton, an eclectic spiritual teacher in New York City, took Ram
Dass to see a woman she felt he should meet. He came into a room where a
woman was sitting, apparently in deep samadhi. He was invited to verify
her trance state by putting a mirror under her nose and trying various
means to get her attention. It appeared to him that the trance was real.
He then sat in the room for awhile meditating with her.</p>
<p>Abruptly she came out of her trance, and then appeared to channel
Maharajji to him. The information being channeled seemed to be kinds of
things Maharajji would discuss and things that Ram Dass had never
mentioned to anyone. He was impressed, but at the same time he felt
repelled by her excessive makeup, jewelry and vile language. It was
explained to him that the woman was an incarnation of the Hindu deity
Kali. Kali is a manifestation of the Divine Mother, who purifies people
by appearing very frightening. This seemed to be a legitimate
explanation for feeling uneasy about her.</p>
<p>After vacillating for several weeks, Ram Dass decided to commit himself
to taking teachings from this woman. Although the teacher and teachings
he was receiving were supposed to be a secret, word spread among the
Western devotees of Maharajji, and soon New York City became an unlikely
Mecca for dozens of them who came to attend secret classes with this
teacher.</p>
<p>Later, Ram Dass wrote an exposé of his two year involvement with this
teacher. His description of the complicated web of lies, deception,
sexual misconduct and drug use by his teacher portrays a classic example
of a psychopath pretending to be a saint.</p>
<section id="there-are-more-psychopaths-than-saints">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.1. </span>There are more psychopaths than saints</h3>
<p>Psychopaths pretending to be saints present a very serious problem for
all spiritual traditions. There are many more psychopaths pretending to
be saints than there are real saints. If you have a true saint for a
teacher, then you have a real possibility for spiritual attainments,
including enlightenment. If your teacher is a psychopath, then you may
become a programmed puppet, and you risk being , sexually or financially
abused. You also may lose your job, your family and possibly even your
sanity. Eventually you risk disillusionment in the pursuit of any
spiritual quests.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this book I define a saint as any true spiritual
seeker who, through a process of study, discipline, prayer, or
meditation has attained a purification of mind and true spiritual
understanding. In the Buddhist tradition a saint would be fully
enlightened, although a legitimate teacher would be one who has attained
at least the first of four levels of enlightenment.</p>
<p>A psychopath is someone who is morally defective and does not respect
the values of property, truth and proper consideration for the effect of
actions on self and others. Generally mental health professionals do not
regard psychopaths as mentally ill because they do not manifest obvious
dysfunctional behavior, but they appear to be rational. Most
professionals prefer the terms <em>sociopaths</em>, <em>borderline personalities</em>,
or <em>antisocials.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps it is because my degree in psychology dates back to 1959 that I
prefer the old fashioned term <em>psychopath</em>. I am doubtful that
changing the name for each current vogue in professional understanding
contributes to the public’s understanding of this very important issue.
Also, my direct personal experience with psychopaths has reinforced the
view that psychopaths are indeed mentally ill, even if the signs are not
immediately obvious.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-origins-of-psychopathy">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.2. </span>The origins of psychopathy</h3>
<p>The origins of psychopathy occur in early childhood when prolonged
periods of feeling the unbearable pain of being unloved are experienced.
Actually psychopaths may have been loved, but their parents’ problems
with marriage, career, health, drinking, drugs, travel, etc. may have
kept them from adequately expressing it. When the child had problems, he
or she felt that there was no one to whom to turn for support, guidance
and love. Most children who have this type of experience simply become
neurotic, but others experience a more sinister development: As the
stress builds, they feel that everyone and everything is the source of
their suffering. They reach a breaking point and make a conscious
decision to get even with the world. From that point on they feel that
any harm they cause others is justified revenge. They become juvenile
delinquents, and by the time they become young adults their pattern of
behavior becomes so deeply rooted that they are virtually incurable.</p>
<p>There are two general types of psychopaths. One type is overtly violent,
and most of them quickly end up in prison for murder or a series of
violent crimes. The other is a covert type that is actually much more
dangerous and can cause both violent and nonviolent suffering to large
numbers of people. There are no limits to the amount of damage a
psychopath can do. Hitler, Stalin, and Saddham Hussein are examples of
psychopaths who did great damage when they seized political control.</p>
<p>You should understand that being a psychopath is not a black or white
situation, but is measured on a gradient scale, and we all have some
element of a psychopath in our personality. It is only when this
characteristic is strong enough to dominate the personality that the
label <em>psychopath</em> should be used. Even when this occurs some people
are only slightly psychopathic and others are very psychopathic.</p>
<p>Very psychopathic people rarely remain long amid the byproducts of their
actions even if they are the covert type. They either end up in prison,
or are constantly on the move from place to place. They rarely acquire
an advanced education, establish themselves in a career, or become
recognized as useful persons in society.</p>
<p>However, slightly to moderately psychopathic persons can become
established in a community, and covert psychopaths can have
extraordinarily attractive and charismatic personalities. The
entertainment business and advertising seem to attract a
disproportionately large number of psychopaths perhaps because both
professions involve creating illusions. They may be doctors, perhaps
with fake degrees, who frequently are charged with malpractice. They may
be lawyers who become deeply , involved with criminals and scam artists.
They may be politicians who take bribes and abuse the powers of office.
They may be psychotherapists who seduce or enslave their clients. They
may be business people who sell shoddy merchandise, inflate repairs and
do not honor guarantees. They may be religious leaders pretending to be
saints.</p>
</section>
<section id="distinguishing-saints-from-psychopaths">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.3. </span>Distinguishing saints from psychopaths</h3>
<p>Distinguishing a saint from a psychopath presents a unique problem
because they have some common characteristics that seem at first to be
identical. Both saints and psychopaths can have the appearance of a
beautiful, radiant and attractive being. Both may tell you, ‘Be here
now, forget the past, forget the future; be spontaneous, heed your inner
voice, follow your bliss.” Both may advise you to not be bound by
traditional social values but by higher spiritual values. Both may have
messages from God or spiritual teachings tailored just for <strong>you</strong>.
Both may be homeless wanderers. Both may manifest fearless behavior
and may risk persecution. Saints and psychopaths can be intuitively
perceptive of people’s mood changes, new developments, and new
understandings. They may appear to manifest similar psychic powers,
healing, mind reading, and channeling from other realms.</p>
<p>Although the powers of a saint and a psychopath may seem the same at
first, they have different roots. Saints have a calm, clear, empowered
state of mind as a result of discipline, meditation, and introspection.
Psychopaths can develop <em>paranoid samadhi</em>, which is a concentrated
mind, because they have done so many unskillful things such as lying,
theft, injury, adultery, substance abuse, etc. Their powers come from
having to have a very sensitive awareness to perceive when someone is
coming after them. They are also gluttons for attention, and when they
have your attention they will start to feed on your spiritual energies
like a psychic vampire. They can sometimes read minds, tell the future,
do healings, see things which aren’t physically apparent and you may
become mesmerized and convinced of their divine power.</p>
<p>So how do we tell saints from psychopaths? My teacher, Sayadaw U
Pandita, says that he never makes up his mind about peoples
enlightenment until he has known them and observed them closely for a
year. It is in the nature of saints to respond to sincere requests for
help, and guidance. If you sincerely want help they will be there for
you. They may ask you to make commitments once you are training under
their guidance, but there is unlikely to be an initial urgent
commitment. Psychopaths, on the other hand, are more likely to come on
to you with an initial urgency, demanding that you make a commitment
immediately or lose your opportunity. Therefore, my first advice about
telling saints from psychopaths is to <strong>take your time.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="amoral-or-immoral">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.4. </span>Amoral or immoral?</h3>
<p>In time some very distinguishing differences between saints and
psychopaths become apparent. Saints have such a deeply rooted morality
from their own direct understanding that by normal social standards they
may be amoral. The Buddha clashed with his culture by disparaging rites
and rituals and not respecting caste. Christ, too, conflicted with his
culture.</p>
<p>Psychopaths, on the other hand, are simply immoral. Their divergence
from social standards involves self gratification and disregard for
doing harm. At first it may be difficult to discern whether a teacher is
amoral or immoral, but in time it may become apparent whether or not he
or she adheres to the standards of behavior being taught. The situation
that Ram Dass found himself in was that of having a teacher who insisted
that everyone tell the truth, but she herself constantly lied. She
forbade the use of drugs, but used them habitually. She insisted on
celibacy for her students, but practiced adultery.</p>
<p>I use a standard of evaluation I call SAY, MEAN, DO. Saints will say
what they mean and will do what they say. Psychopaths will mean
something other than what they say and what they do may have little
relationship to what they say and mean. For example, psychopaths may say
they love you or want to help you, when what they mean is that they want
attention or money. What they do in the long run is going to be a
disappointment. It takes a while for consistency or inconsistency of
SAY, MEAN, DO to come into focus. The more time you take in evaluating
this the more accurate your conclusion will be.</p>
</section>
<section id="seeds-of-destruction">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.5. </span>Seeds of destruction</h3>
<p>Psychopaths are constantly planting the seeds of their own destruction,
so it is good to look and listen carefully for this. When new
psychopaths arrive on the scene, they or their co-psychopathic entourage
will tell you many stories of how successful and well respected they
were at their previous locations. However, in time they or other people
will begin to tell stories of great conflict and discord at their
previous places. Listen carefully to these stories and you will hear
that they <em>were</em> at the center of these problems. Listen more
carefully and you will see that they were the cause of these problems.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-big-lie">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.6. </span>The Big Lie</h3>
<p>Psychopaths frequently make use of the Big Lie method, so you should
critically evaluate the plausibility of the claims people make. You
should be very suspicious when someone claims that 98% of cancers were
cured, or 99% of the marriages they arranged were successful, or 100% of
their students become enlightened. Almost all of such claims are made by
psychopaths, especially if they repeat such claims over and over again.</p>
</section>
<section id="spiritual-scenes">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.7. </span>Spiritual scenes</h3>
<p>Spiritual scenes are fertile feeding grounds for psychopaths. There are
always new members and teachers arriving and there is a bias to welcome
and accept them as being wonderful. Psychopaths thrive on not having to
verify what they say. They frequently get away with claiming to be
enlightened, the reincarnation of some deity, delivering messages from
God, or having special spiritual powers.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-chorus-of-psychopaths">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.8. </span>The chorus of psychopaths</h3>
<p>It is common for psychopaths to pick up ideas from each other.
Channeling is a classic example. From time to time there is a chorus of
psychopaths proclaiming that California is about to fall into the ocean,
or that Earth will be hit by a comet next August. When the disaster
doesn’t happen they will say that their prayers prevented it. How do you
immediately check out the validity of channeled information? Generally
speaking you can’t, other than reflecting on the plausibility of their
claims and waiting to see what happens.</p>
</section>
<section id="more-claims-than-comets">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.9. </span>More claims than comets</h3>
<p>Of course, you may miss out on the excitement of being a close disciple
of the next avatar or messiah. You may drown when California sinks.
Remember that avatars come every thousand years or so and a comet hits
Earth every 100,000 years despite the proliferation of claims. In the
last two thousand years there have been tens of thousands of predictions
of drastic earth changes and not one has come to pass. You may feel
attracted to a radiant being who is making unlikely claims and offering
a shortcut to spiritual development. If you want a short cut to
spiritual development, consider Russian roulette. The odds are better
and the chance of suffering from a mistake is less.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-pattern-of-avoiding-punishment">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.10. </span>The pattern of avoiding punishment</h3>
<p>Psychopaths skillfully evade blame when they are confronted with having
done something wrong. Since they lack a true sense of guilt, they do not
respond the way you may expect a guilty person to behave. Psychopaths
have a very distinctive sequence of responses to dealing with
confrontations. If one method of stopping a confrontation does not work,
they will change strategies. When confronted with wrong-doing, a
psychopath will respond in this sequence:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Ignore the issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Deny that they have done something wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Attack the accuser, usually accusing the accuser of being the one
who has done wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Threaten to harm the accuser, someone else, something, or self.</p></li>
<li><p>Apologize and admit that they have done wrong, then ask for a clean
slate or new start</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A saint, on the other hand, will either immediately admit that he or she
has made an error, or ask for clarification and seek reconciliation. An
example would be Christ’s advice that when someone asks for your coat
you should give your cloak also. Generally, saints will place a higher
value on harmonious relationships than on pride or possessions. We must
allow for cultural factors and personality characteristics, but when
confronted with wrong-doing, saints generally will follow this sequence:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Acknowledge errors and misunderstandings</p></li>
<li><p>Admit that they have made an error</p></li>
<li><p>Apologize</p></li>
<li><p>Offer compensation or correction</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid that type of error in the future</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first strategy of the saint is the last strategy of a psychopath.
But when psychopaths are finally forced to apologize they will outdo the
saints. Their previous belligerent attitudes will vanish. They will
apologize profusely and confess the error of their ways in great detail.
They may even list wrongdoings that you were unaware of, to impress you
with the depth of their change. Their transformation seems quite
impressive and even professionals who should know better are sometimes
taken in by their pretense. Judges have suspended sentences of repeat
bigamists and outrageous con artists who swore to devote the rest of
their lives to making restitution.</p>
<p>“Give me a clean slate”, is the refrain of psychopaths. They will proclaim
that they are a new person or that they have been born again. Sometimes
they insist that they should not be punished because the person who did
those things no longer exists. Indeed they may make drastic changes in
their behavior, from being rude and domineering to being humble and
submissive. It is, however, all a ruse to get off the hook. For awhile
after being caught psychopaths may go through a quiescent period, but in
time the same old patterns of behavior will reoccur. They are not bound
by conscience or true remorse. As soon as you walk out the door they may
revert to their old ways without skipping a beat.</p>
</section>
<section id="psychopaths-are-self-destructive">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.11. </span>Psychopaths are self-destructive</h3>
<p>You should remember that the essential characteristic of psychopaths is
that they are self-destructive and destructive of those around them.
Sooner or later things are going to turn out bad. Having a psychopath
around is like having a pet rattlesnake running loose in your house.
When you determine that someone is psychopathic, you should make an
immediate clean break with them.</p>
<p>Threatening a psychopath is like waving a red flag at a bull. Our
legislators should be aware of this when they pass laws. Laws which
motivate normal people to avoid crime may result in psychopaths
committing more crime. Psychopaths are essentially self-destructive and
so to threaten psychopaths with destruction if they break a law only
increases their motivation. All too often our system of punishment
results in sending psychopaths to prison which becomes a school for
learning psychopathic tricks. Associations made in prison result in the
establishment of a more dangerous network of psychopaths in society
after they leave prison.</p>
</section>
<section id="psychopaths-crave-attention">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.12. </span>Psychopaths crave attention</h3>
<p>As a result of not having received love and attention as a child,
psychopaths have an almost unlimited need for attention. One of the
signs of a psychopath is that wherever they go they tend to become the
center of attention. It doesn’t matter to them whether they do something
good or bad as long as they get attention. They can be benefactors as
easily as they can be dangerous and may steal things to give to someone
else. At parties they become the focal point of jokes, speeches, pranks,
story telling, arguments, fights, singing, dancing and intense activity
where they are the center of attention. They are skillful, talented,
entertaining, argumentative and accident prone. At lectures and meetings
they become the center of attention by asking many questions, making
statements about how they oppose something, or how they applaud and
approve of what is being said. If they can’t get attention in a group,
they will usually be doing lots of fidgeting in their seat, like O.J.
Simpson did at his trial. If they no longer can get your attention by
dominating you, then they can shift to seeking your assistance in
helping them rehabilitate themselves or recover from an accident.</p>
</section>
<section id="motivating-with-guilt">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.13. </span>Motivating with guilt</h3>
<p>Another sign to watch for is that psychopaths tend to motivate you with
guilt. Anything you do wrong becomes a lever for manipulating you. This
is particularly true if you break, or threaten to break a promise, even
though they usually have poor records in keeping promises.</p>
</section>
<section id="anxiety-attacks">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.14. </span>Anxiety attacks</h3>
<p>There is one sign of a psychopath that usually only a close associate
will have an opportunity to see. From time to time a psychopath will
have anxiety attacks. They hide alone, or with someone totally under
their control, when they become panicked about their health, fear of
being arrested, assassinated, or attacked by devils, spirits, etc.
Sometimes anxiety attacks last days or weeks, or sometimes only brief
moments, especially if they get their co-psychopath motivated to do
something for them as a result.</p>
</section>
<section id="organizations">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.15. </span>Organizations</h3>
<p>Most organizations, especially spiritual organizations, tend to make
rules of various types as a result of their encounters with psychopaths.
This can be useful in some circumstances, but usually the result is
complexity and inconvenience for the members of the organization. The
psychopaths will simply break the rule if they can get away with it, or
do something else which is equally bad but not against the rules.
Organizations would be better advised to develop an awareness of
psychopaths and establish a system for getting rid of them.</p>
<p>Too often the initial impression that a psychopath makes on people is
very positive. This is especially true in spiritual organizations.
Sometimes psychopaths have an attractive, radiant appearance. They stand
out in a group and people are likely to feel especially drawn to them.
An organization would be well advised to be extra cautious about
becoming involved with any unusually attractive or impressive newcomer.</p>
<p>Another thing to watch for in spotting psychopaths is that a group of
people is likely to have a polarized mix in their response to a
psychopath. Quite likely some people are going to feel extraordinarily
drawn to a particular newcomer, and others will have a strong negative
reaction to him or her. Typically, in time, everyone in the group is
either going to develop a strong liking or disliking for a psychopath.</p>
<p>Psychopaths are dangerous even in legitimate organizations with honest
leadership. If a psychopath comes on the scene bad things are bound to
happen. Businesses become inoperable, teams become disorganized,
families break up. Psychopaths are likely to be trouble makers,
embezzlers, drug dealers, or get the organization involved with illegal
dealings. The morale of the organization is likely to deteriorate, and
the staff is likely to become divided into warring camps.</p>
</section>
<section id="buddhism">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.16. </span>Buddhism</h3>
<p>Buddhism has fewer psychopaths than other major religious traditions.
This is partly because Buddhists have a clearer idea of what
enlightenment is, and leaders are more likely to spot someone who is
pretending to be enlightened. Also, Buddhism is outwardly comparatively
boring. Psychopaths are more likely to be attracted to singing, dancing,
love, light, miracles, and channeling. Usually psychopaths have a great
deal of trouble sitting quiet and still. I appreciate the boring facade
of Buddhism, as it is a great protection.</p>
<p>At the same time the comparative scarcity of psychopaths in Buddhism
leaves Buddhists more vulnerable to them. A psychopath may be sitting at
the back of a meditation hall reading a book while everyone else is
meditating. Occasionally even monks in monasteries get involved in
strictly forbidden activities, such as sex, drugs, lying and stealing
and get away with it because no one expects monks to do such things.</p>
<p>Generally you are safer choosing a Buddhist teacher who has been
authorized to teach by a widely recognized teacher or tradition. Of
course, psychopaths may claim authorization to teach, but they usually
do not maintain close association with their tradition or other
teachers. On the other hand, exceptionally good teachers frequently
develop their own styles of practice which are different from their
tradition. As a rule of thumb you would do well to avoid teachers who
proclaim their enlightenment and put down other teachers. Although some
of the most effective teachers in the West are laypeople, monks and nuns
make safer teachers than laypeople, especially if they are actively
associated with their tradition.</p>
</section>
<section id="co-psychopaths">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.17. </span>Co-psychopaths</h3>
<p>Although prospects for fundamental change in psychopaths is unlikely,
the prospects for change in co-psychopaths are very good. Co-psychopaths
are close associates of psychopaths who are caught up in their web of
control and deception. They may be a spouses, partners or disciples.
They, themselves are usually not morally defective, but they have
accepted the artificial reality that the psychopaths have created, and
they believe that the psychopaths’ behavior is acceptable because of
their divinity, illness, abused childhood, enlightenment, etc. They have
been programmed by the psychopath to lie, cheat, steal, or even murder.
It is usually the disparity between their own inner sense of morality
and the rationalized, programmed morality of the psychopath that causes
them to break away. Frequently the self destructive nature of
psychopaths will lead them to overplay their hand and cause their
co-psychopaths to break away. Sometimes <em>co</em>-psychopaths leave
repeatedly and then return to their psychopath.</p>
<p>Psychopaths can be a disaster for an organization if they succeed in
getting a manager or teacher into a co-psychopathic role. There are some
signs to watch for when a legitimate spiritual teacher becomes involved
with a psychopathic partner: Teachers will have much less time to devote
to their teaching. There will be a greater emphasis on the teachers
making money either directly or indirectly as a result of their
teaching. The teacher may leave to start a new organization, or many key
people will leave. A new emphasis or activity will develop in the
teachings. The teacher may get involved with some immoral or illegal
activity. These signs do not mean a teacher has become immoral per se,
but it is an indication of the power of their partner to create a web of
commitments and distort reality.</p>
</section>
<section id="helping-a-co-psychopath">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.18. </span>Helping a co-psychopath</h3>
<p>Even after co-psychopaths break away, the roots of their programming are
deep, and there is a possibility that they may return to the control and
influence of the psychopath. It is a pattern of behavior similar to that
of co-alcoholics and abused spouses. Even when co-psychopaths are
successful in breaking away, there are prolonged periods during which
they gradually realize the extent of the artificial reality that they
adopted. Some never figure out what happened, other than realizing that
the relationship was unwholesome for them. Co-psychopaths may need
psychotherapy and support groups to overcome the inner conflicts they
experience. Their chances for recovery are very good. It is highly
recommended that co-psychopaths seek relationships with people or groups
that have had similar experience, such as former members of religious
cults.</p>
<p>If you have extricated yourself from a group dominated by a psychopath,
you will have a strong desire to get your friends out of it too. Unless
your friends in the group are expressing some doubts or reservations, it
is usually fruitless to trying to talk them into leaving. Co-psychopaths
are too caught up in the artificial reality of the psychopath to hear
your advice. If you try too hard to convince them, you will succeed only
in breaking off communication. The best strategy for a friend is to wait
until they show signs of doubt and give them understanding support at
the right time.</p>
</section>
<section id="purity-of-motives-offers-protection">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.19. </span>Purity of motives offers protection</h3>
<p>Some of the spiritual teachings you need to learn concern impurities in
your seeking. To the extent that your seeking is motivated by desires
for power, prestige, sex, sense desires, etc., you are vulnerable to
being seduced by a psychopath. To the extent that you are motivated to
become enlightened or to purify your mind of defilements, then you are
on safe ground. Usually our motives are a mixture of good and bad. If
you are a true spiritual seeker, you will convert experiences with
psychopaths to a process of purification which decreases your lower
motives and increases higher motives.</p>
</section>
<section id="psychopaths-do-not-want-to-be-cured">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.20. </span>Psychopaths do not want to be cured</h3>
<p>One of the most tragic aspects of psychopaths is that even though they
may pretend to want to change, they really do not want to. Psychopaths
are rarely responsive to psychotherapy. They are difficult to cure
because they don’t want to be cured. On rare occasions, they come to
reflect on their lives during a mid-life crisis and may truly desire to
change. Even then, it may take extensive psychotherapy with expensive
specialists to induce a true transformation of behavior. These rare
occasions occur only when they come to the desire to change on their
own, and <strong>not when they have been caught and are only pretending to
want to change.</strong></p>
<p>It is not advisable to try to reform or cure psychopaths. The
best advice is to learn to identify them and develop a strategy for
cutting off the relationship. Although a relationship with a psychopath
is painful, it is also an opportunity to enhance your spiritual growth
and purify your own motives. Be patient with friends who are under the
control of a psychopath, and be ready to help them when they express
doubts. Awareness of the problem of psychopaths is half of the solution.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.1.21. </span>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Although there is a superficial similarity between saints and
psychopaths, we can in time distinguish between them by objectively
observing their behavior. We all have some psychopathic tendencies, as
well as tendencies to be saints, but when these tendencies predominate,
we use the label <em>psychopath or saint</em>. When we encounter some
extraordinarily impressive personality, we would be wise to ask
ourselves if this is the personality of a psychopath. Observe their
behavior carefully to determine if they say what they mean and do what
they say and mean. There is a <em>Checklist for Saints and Psychopaths</em>
on the next page, and there are extra copies which can be removed at
the end of this book. Keep this list handy and review it from time to
time.</p>

<section id="screw-u">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.2. </span>Screw U</h2>
<p>In 1986 I gave a talk on the subject of Saints &amp; Psychopaths at a
meditation retreat that I lead with Shinzen Young. Several years later,
a tape of this talk was played on a Los Angeles radio station. The next
day I received many phone calls from people who wanted copies of this
tape and more information on the subject. It turned out that about half
of the people calling were mental health professionals.</p>
<p>One of the callers asked me about my education. I spontaneously replied
that I had gone to Screw U. Although I have a BA. degree in Psychology
(Ohio State University 1959), my advanced studies have come from my
personal contact with psychopaths in daily life. I encountered several
psychopaths when I was a businessman, when I was involved with
intentional communities and also in religious organizations. One of the
most valuable courses I took at Screw U was with a teacher I shared with
Ram Dass.</p>
<p>While I was manager of the Hanuman Foundation Tape Library I received
teachings from a teacher with whom Ram Dass was also receiving
teachings. It was the same teacher described in the previous chapter. I
regarded Ram Dass as my teacher, so I automatically gave the status of
being a legitimate teacher to his teacher. It is unlikely that I would
have been attracted to this teacher had Ram Dass not been involved.</p>
<p>After I had been involved with this teacher for about a year, Ram Dass
announced to his students that he no longer felt that his new teacher
was a legitimate teacher. Even though he gave a very clear and honest
explanation for changing his mind, it took a couple of months for me to
fully see that he was correct. I learned a great deal from the process
of getting involved with and extricating myself from, association with
this teacher.</p>
<section id="the-hindu-tradition">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.1. </span>The Hindu Tradition</h3>
<p>It is helpful to understand some aspects of the Hindu and Buddhist
teachings which Ram Dass taught. In the Hindu tradition the ultimate
objective is to merge your consciousness with God. Enlightenment is an
implied part of this process. Since it is difficult to merge your
consciousness directly with God, it is recommended that you merge your
consciousness with enlightened beings who are capable of merging their
consciousness with God. Usually there is a hierarchy of beings involved
with this process of merging consciousness with God. Devotees should
strive to merge their consciousness with their guru who is enlightened.
The guru has merged consciousness with his/her guru and a lineage of
gurus who have Merged with some deity such as Krishna, or Shiva, who has
merged with God. If your guru is enlightened, then it is quite possible
that this arrangement may hasten your attainment of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Although this system offers a short cut to enlightenment, it also offers
an opportunity for infinite mischief for a psychopath. A devotee should
cultivate an attitude of total oneness, trust and obedience to a guru. A
legitimate guru will use this attitude only to expedite the devotee’s
spiritual growth and will not use it for personal benefit. If you choose
the path of devotion, you should be able to distinguish between a saint
and a psychopath.</p>
</section>
<section id="buddhism-and-hinduism">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.2. </span>Buddhism and Hinduism</h3>
<p>Just as Jesus Christ was a revolutionary in Jewish culture, the Buddha
was a radical revolutionary in Hindu culture. He encouraged questioning
of spiritual authority and on a number of occasions set down principles
for judging the validity of spiritual teachers and teachings, He
directly rejected the idea of giving someone high spiritual status
because of the status of their parents. He frequently challenged the
idea that rites and rituals such as animal sacrifices, or bathing in a
holy river could absolve sin. Some of his views were so contrary to
Hindu culture that this may be one of the reasons that Buddhism died out
in the land of its origin. The Mogul invaders formed alliances with some
Hindu kings and eliminated all Buddhist monasteries and temples.</p>
<p>The oldest lineage of Buddhism, the Theravada tradition, lacks the
devotion to many different deities that is characteristic of the
Mahayana tradition. However, there is some expeditious value to devotion
as a means of speeding the progress of a student’s development. The
Mahayana tradition evolved for a long period amid Hindu culture after
the Theravada tradition had gone to Sri Lanka. The Mahayana tradition
has many more characteristics similar to Hindu culture than the older
Theravada tradition. The Mahayana tradition places the greatest emphasis
on enlightenment, but makes use of devotional qualities similar to the
Hindu tradition by worshiping gurus and many deities. Ram Dass’ new
teacher was primarily a Hindu teacher, but made use of some Buddhist
Mahayana teachings.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-mysterious-teacher">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.3. </span>The mysterious teacher</h3>
<p>I heard the first rumors about this teacher in November of 1974 when I
attended a ten-day <em>Vipassana</em> retreat with Ram Dass and many devotees
of Neem Karoli Baba Maharajji lead by Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield
and Richard Barsky. At the end of the retreat Ram Dass mentioned to me
that he had found a new teacher, but strangely he would say nothing else
about this teacher. Someone else told me that he was taking teachings
from a Brooklyn housewife who had become spontaneously enlightened in
her bathroom.</p>
<p>I decided to visit friends on Long Island, New York to see if I could
get information about this new teacher. It soon became clear that my
friends were involved with this teacher too, but they would say nothing
about her or what they did with her. Several of my friends would
mysteriously join a car pool and drive somewhere together, then return
several hours later. After a few days I decided that I was going to
learn nothing more, so I decided to return to Colorado.</p>
<p>At that time I was managing the Hanuman Foundation Tape Library in
Boulder, Colorado. Two of my employees had been close devotees of
Maharajji and spent many years in India with him. Soon after my return
they received letters, from friends in New York that said devotees who
had been in India with Maharajji were welcome to attend the secret
classes. My employees wanted to go to New York to see what was going on,
so we drove to New York together. I figured that my association with my
employees would get my foot in the door and it did.</p>
<p>My employees were immediately included in all of the secret classes. We
were staying with friends in New York City. As before, they would
mysteriously join a car pool and go off to classes for several hours
each day. I did get some more information on the nature of the classes.
Most of the classes were held on week days in large houses occupied only
by students, or in the home of the teacher while her husband was at
work. There were five classes a week and the largest was over 100 people
on Wednesdays in a rented class room. The classes were different sizes
and only about a dozen people including Ram Dass were permitted to go to
all of the secret classes. Of course, the secrecy and exclusivity of
these classes increased my desire to belong to them.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-call-from-the-teacher">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.4. </span>A call from the teacher</h3>
<p>After we had been in New York for a couple of days, I received a phone
call. It was the teacher and without telling me who she was, she
aggressively asked me many questions about my sex life. It seems that I
dealt with these questions satisfactorily as I was told that a car would
come immediately and take me for a face to face interview.</p>
<p>The interview was conducted in front of a class of about three dozen
people. The interview involved many questions about the type of
spiritual practices I had done, where I lived and my relationship to Ram
Dass. It was made clear in the interview that I wasn’t quite up to the
high standards of spiritual development that was required for her
students, but it was implied that I had some potential if I worked
hard. At the end of the interview she told to see Hilda Charlton who
would assign me special practices to, as she said, “Clean me up.”</p>
<p>Hilda Charlton was a devotee of Nityananda, who was one of the most
famous gurus in India before he died. After the death of Nityananda,
Hilda lived several years in the monasteries of Sai Baba. Sai Baba has
long been the most famous guru in India and his monasteries are large
and luxurious.</p>
<p>Sai Baba had authorized Hilda to teach a class in New York City as part
of his organization. Two or three hundred people would attend her
Thursday night classes at Saint John the Divine Cathedral on Manhattan
Island. Hilda was the one who had discovered our secret teacher and
introduced Ram Dass to her.</p>
<p>When I went to see Hilda, she gave me instructions to be celibate,
vegetarian, to meditate, to do breathing exercises, and pray to the
Virgin Mary every day to relieve my sins. She told me to return to
Colorado and do these practices for three months before returning to New
York. I then went to Ram Dass who told me that I could attend secret
Tuesday night classes that the teacher had told him to conduct.</p>
</section>
<section id="from-boulder-to-new-york">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.5. </span>From Boulder to New York</h3>
<p>Since my employees were being admitted to all classes, we decided to
move the Hanuman Foundation Tape Library from Boulder to New York. Ram
Dass instructed me to rent a house in Queens on Long Island for the Tape
Library and for six of his students. My employees were assigned a
different house to live in. At this time there were six other houses in
Queens which each had about a dozen students living in them, but this
was the only one with just Ram Dass students.</p>
<p>A week after we moved into the house we all found ourselves in the
kitchen at one time. It was clear that we needed to get organized as to
cleaning and other chores; we decided to have a house meeting. Within a
minute the phone rang. It was our mysterious teacher who promptly told
us to call off the meeting. She appointed the person who answered the
phone the house leader and said that she would send Ram Dass to come the
next morning at 4 A.M. to conduct the house meeting. We were all quite
impressed at the timing of the call and the special attention we had
received.</p>
</section>
<section id="attending-secret-classes">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.6. </span>Attending secret classes</h3>
<p>It was not long until every one in the house except myself was attending
secret classes. It was clear that I was the low man on the totem pole in
terms of spiritual development. Then about a month later, I received a
call from the teacher who yelled at me, “Why are you not here!” It
seemed that she was trying to make me feel guilty. But very clearly no
one had told me to attend. She told me to show up for the largest class
next Wednesday.</p>
<p>I felt honored that the diligent work on the various practices I had
been assigned had paid off, and that I did not have to wait the three
months that Hilda had mentioned. The Wednesday class was packed like
sardines. We all sat on the floor, knee to knee, for about 3 hours
without getting up. The teacher knew each of us by name, and during the
class she had a brief interchange with everyone in the room. I was quite
impressed with how appropriate her questions to me were ond how accurate
her observations were. Wednesday was the day set aside for new students
and visitors. On occasion she would exorcise a devil, or do a healing
for newcomers. It was an interesting and dramatic class.</p>
<p>About a half dozen very advanced students who, we were told had psychic
powers sat in front and there would be occasional exchanges with them.
The teacher might ask them what invisible deities were in the room and
then tell them that they had observed correctly. It seemed that this
must be one of the most important places in the world since so many
important gods dropped by for visits. The advanced students would praise
our teacher for her love and devotion she had for her students and the
wonderful results of her teachings. In turn the teacher would praise the
advanced students for their enlightenment, psychic powers and tell them
how important they were. Clearly we were a very special group of people
to be honored by receiving such teachings.</p>
<p>After about three hours our teacher and about twenty advanced students
would leave the main room for special advanced teachings; the rest of us
were told to remain and meditate. Usually Hilda would be left in charge
of leading the meditations of the main group. After a while the teacher
would leave the second group and tell them to meditate while she took a
few of them to another room for even more advanced special teachings.
Finally, she would leave that group with Ram Dass to give him very
advanced teachings.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-divine-mother">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.7. </span>The Divine Mother</h3>
<p>We were constantly reminded that our teacher was an incarnation of the
Hindu goddess Kali. Kali is the wrathful aspect of the Divine Mother,
who is regarded as the mother of the world or reality. The Kali aspect
of the Divine Mother is frightening, the way a mother who loves her
children frightens them with punishment if they misbehaved, Kali has
black hair, black skin, and blood dripping from her mouth. She cuts off
the heads of sinful beings and wears their heads in a necklace around
her neck. Kali banishes sin and impurity from her children. Only the
spiritually pure are safe from the wrath of Kali.</p>
<p>Our teacher had long jet black hair, and it sometimes seemed that her
normal dark complexion took on a decidedly black tone. We were
repeatedly told she would take on our karma and as a result, we were
told, she would bleed copious quantities of blood from her mouth. On
occasion, students who were her attendants in her home would call other
students and tell them that their teacher was bleeding so much that they
were worried about her health. They were sometimes told that the
bleeding was from taking on the karma of their sin of doubt, and they
were reminded what a great sacrifice she was making because of her love
for them.</p>
<p>Our teacher had enormous amounts of energy. On occasion we had marathon
classes which would last sixteen hours, and she would be full of divine
energy when everyone else was ready to drop. We were told that she did
not sleep, but there would be times that she would go into a deep state
of samadhi for hours. It was not unusual for people to receive phone
calls from her at two or four o’clock in the morning. Her style was to
challenge people and make them feel guilty. She used vile language and
usually brought up subjects which would embarrass them, such as their
sexual inclinations. The ultimate punishment was to be banned from
attending classes, although most who were banned would eventually be
permitted to return.</p>
</section>
<section id="ram-dass-leaves-the-teachings">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.8. </span>Ram Dass leaves The Teachings</h3>
<p>After I had been there for about six months, our teacher announced that
Ram Dass would be leaving what we called <em>The Teachings</em>. Ram Dass
continued to attend classes for another month, but there were big
changes after this announcement. There were greater melodramas after Ram
Dass departed. It was announced that someone was trying to assassinate
our teacher, and we were told to be on the lookout for strangers with
guns. We were told that some lamas had come from Tibet to persuade our
teacher to return to Tibet with them. They had determined that she was
an incarnation of a deity, and they wanted her to return to her temple
so that they could worship her. Our teacher disappeared for several
days, and we were told that she was experiencing an overload of
spiritual energy. All students were instructed to sit up all night in
meditation to psychically draw off the excess energy so she could return
home. Then it was announced that our teacher had left her husband, and
they were going to be divorced. Again the teacher disappeared, but this
time a few students started to get phone calls to join her in Florida.</p>
<p>A few people had chosen to leave The Teachings before Ram Dass departed,
but after he left many more began to leave. I noticed that for a while
after people left they maintained a respect for our teacher, but about a
month after they left they developed a strong dislike for both The
Teachings and the teacher. It was a puzzle that took me a few months to
figure out.</p>
<p>The departing students left vacancies in the advanced classes, and
suddenly I found myself promoted to all of the most advanced secret
classes. It didn’t occur to me that the special attention that I was
receiving was because I had a close association with Ram Dass. Our
teacher was constantly pumping me for information to discover what Ram
Dass was doing and saying. As time went on, it became apparent that
there were various intrigues going on between the teacher and Ram Dass
as gifts were returned and confidences were betrayed. The teacher and
Ram Dass would deliberately give me conflicting instructions, and it was
clear that they were both trying to get me to make a choice between
them. Other students were also placed in circumstances where they had do
choose which teacher to follow.</p>
</section>
<section id="ram-dass-confesses">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.9. </span>Ram Dass confesses</h3>
<p>Finally about three months after his departure, Ram Dass made a public
explanation as to why he left The Teachings. He announced to his Tuesday
night class that he had been deceived into believing that the teacher
was enlightened. His suspicions started when the teacher made sexual
advances to him under the guise of advanced tantric teachings. The
private sessions of advanced teachings that he was supposed to be having
became a cover for a sexual liaison with a married woman. She claimed to
be beyond desire, but it became clearer and clearer to him that she was
motivated by lust. The hypocrisy of having an adulterous sexual
relationship while pretending to be a celibate teacher of celibate
students was too much for him. Eventually he decided to leave, but since
he felt that The Teachings were benefitting others he did not want to
create a schism.</p>
<p>He had intended to quietly leave the teachings without conflict.
However, the teacher would not leave him alone; he was constantly
confronted with dirty tricks instigated by her. When other people left
the teachings, they would come to Ram Dass to share their experiences of
their teacher. Soon a vast web of deception came into focus. The
information that convinced Ram Dass that the teacher was channeling
Maharajji had come from a diary of a woman who had been with him in
India. People who claimed to have seen large amounts of blood come from
her mouth had been instructed to call Ram Dass, Hilda and others to say
they were worried about the amount of blood. Everyone in the inner
circle of students believed that others had seen blood, but when they
compared experiences none had seen it. Her enormous amount of energy
came from pills. Much of her supposed psychic information came from an
intelligence network of her students.</p>
<p>The reason that people who left The Teachings developed dislike for her
within a month after leaving was that they would exchange information
with the others who left. People who remained in the teachings would
rationalize what they heard, or not hear what was being said to them. I
too rationalized what I was being told, and the awareness I developed of
this capacity for rationalization was one of the most valuable lessons I
learned in 1976.</p>
<p>Ram Dass’ revelations about the teacher seemed to me to be
incomprehensible affairs of titans. Worship of the Divine Mother was to
see that all reality was a manifestation of the Divine Mother. The
highest teaching was that even horrible and unpleasant things were also
manifestations of the Divine Mother. To see the Divine Mother behind all
forms of reality was to see the true reality. It was a contradiction in
terms to say someone had deceived me into seeing anyone as the Divine
Mother.</p>
<p>I continued to regard our teacher as the Divine Mother. How could I be
wrong? Everyone and everything was the Divine Mother, and to see things
this way was an assurance that I was on the path to liberation. It
seemed to me that I had benefitted from The Teachings, and I had made a
great deal of progress in my spiritual development. This judgment was
largely based on having progressed from being a rejected outsider to a
key member of the inner circle. This is an example of the dubious types
of reasoning that a co-psychopath is likely to use.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-inner-circle">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.10. </span>The inner circle</h3>
<p>Being in the inner circle provided an opportunity to witness deception
and dishonesty that I had not been aware of before. I witnessed her
taking pills and saw the effect they had on her energy. She took some of
her students on shoplifting excursions, she charged meals to other
people’s hotel rooms. She conspired with students to fake injuries for
insurance claims, and she would habitually tell people things which I
knew were not true. Seeing all of this as the <strong>play</strong> of the Divine
Mother was wearing thin. These things were clearly wrong.</p>
<p>A couple of months after Ram Dass made his revelations, I finally
announced my departure from The Teachings. It was a gradual process like
a balance scale slowly swinging to the other side. I left when the
balance was 51% doubt and 49% faith. In the ensuing weeks and months,
the balance continued to shift to increasing doubt.</p>
<p>Over the years I would occasionally encounter friends who never left The
Teachings. Knowing how their minds would rationalize anything I would
say, I would make little attempt to encourage them to leave. If I had
vigorously tried to get them to leave, they would have cut off
communication with me.</p>
</section>
<section id="special-interpretations-of-reality">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.11. </span>Special interpretations of reality</h3>
<p>Although the method of viewing everything as a manifestation of the
Divine Mother has some value in cultivating a transcendent awareness, it
is a method which can be easily abused. In fact, all methods which
require a special interpretation of reality are potentially dangerous,
especially if a psychopath is involved. The worship of deities, gurus
and teachers can be helpful in attaining liberation, but they all
involve adopting a special view of reality.</p>
</section>
<section id="teachers-should-be-guides">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.2.12. </span>Teachers should be guides</h3>
<p>My personal preference is now to be a light unto myself. My taste in
teachers these days inclines to boring Buddhists who focus directly on
the objective of enlightenment. The Buddha encouraged the attitude that
teachers are guides who are familiar with a path. The guides do not make
the journey for us, but only advise us. From <em>The Dhammapada:</em></p>

<section id="mukti">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.3. </span>Mukti</h2>
<p>Mukti Ma Deva Walla was the name which Neem Kara Baba Maharajji gave to
Jane. Mukti was traveling in India visiting all the big time gurus when
she came to Maharajji. He was famous in the West as the guru of Ram
Dass. Maharajji asked her what she did in America, and she replied that
she and her then current husband, Charles Berner, conducted weekend
Enlightenment Intensives. Maharajji replied to this by giving her the
spiritual name which means Goddess Who Sells Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Mukti came into my life in the summer of 1977. At that time I was living
by the yacht harbor in Santa Cruz, California. I had an income of
$25,000 to $35,000 a year from investments and was managing the Hanuman
Foundation Tape Library as an unpaid volunteer, distributing Ram Dass
tape recordings. Mukti, had been traveling with a friend of mine until
they had decided to go their separate ways, happened to be staying
nearby, so when I heard that there was going to be a gathering of
Maharajji devotees in the Bay Area I left a message at the home where
she was a guest, telling her about it.</p>
<p>Instead of returning the call, she arrived at my house in the evening.
She was on her way to Berkeley, and since it was late she spent the
night. One thing led to another, and we ended up being together for the
next two years. Because many of my friends were devotees of Maharajji,
she started to use the name Mukti.</p>
<section id="feeling-spiritually-desolate">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.1. </span>Feeling spiritually desolate</h3>
<p>I had been feeling spiritually desolate because I had never traveled to
the East and met the great gurus. I had heard stories of miracles,
insight and wonder from Ram Dass and many of my friends who had spent
years traveling and meditating in India, but I had been unable to go on
a spiritual quest because I was responsible for my mother, who was
having a progressive series of strokes. Also, I had founded the Hanuman
Foundation Tape Library four years earlier, and it was in a stage of
development that made a prolonged trip for me impossible.</p>
<p>It did not occur to me that the quality of my meditation practice, the
merit of my work and caring for a parent were more valuable spiritual
activities than an exotic journey. I was fascinated by the stories of
Mukti’s travels around the world and by her acquaintance with many
famous gurus, saints, and teachers. She was adept at getting their
personal attention, and she attributed this to their recognition of her
spiritual development.</p>
<p>At age thirty-three, beautiful and talented, she had given up the
comforts and luxury of a super-rich family to pursue her spiritual
quest, and could tell endless stories of her adventures. She spoke
fluent Greek, Spanish, Hindi and had a working vocabulary of many other
languages. Mukti could sing, dance and draw. She was very intelligent, a
great talker and she could get the attention of anyone she wished.</p>
<p>After we met, we were together constantly for three weeks during which
we told each other the stories of our lives. She was intimately
acquainted with many major gurus and spiritual teachers including Ram
Dass, Ken Keyes, Chinmayananda, Sai Baba, Anandamayi Ma, Swami
Satchitananda, Muktananda, Yogaswar Muni, Al Drecker, Amarit Desai to
mention just a few. She also told me many stories about her mother who
had been married to several different movie stars and millionaires. A
particular set of stories concerned her mother’s yacht in Coca Beach,
Florida; a 71 ft. converted PT boat with a cabin that covered the entire
deck. Mukti said she was receiving $5,000 a month from a trust fund and
was supporting sixteen hippies who lived on the yacht. She had many
adventures with sex and drugs during this time. She would open the yacht
to crowds of people Sunday afternoons when they would play Ram Dass
lectures on the speaker system. I had previously heard stories before
about a yacht at Coca Beach where Ram Dass tapes were played and now
concluded that this was Mukti’s mothers yacht.</p>
<p>Mukti said that it was when she was living on the yacht that she met
Charles Berner, who developed the weekend Enlightenment Intensive and
fell in love with him. She said that he had tried to get her mother to
give them a large amount of money, but her mother was angered by that
and threatened to disown her and cut off her trust fund if she married
Berner. She married Berner anyway, and had not received any trust fund
payments since then.</p>
<p>Although the marriage ended in divorce, her mother had not forgiven her
disobedience, and she still was not receiving her trust fund payments.
Mukti said that eventually she would have to get all the delayed
payments in a lump sum, but she did not want to legally challenge her
mother who was trustee of her fund.</p>
<p>After being together with Mukti constantly for three weeks, I realized
that my office work was piling up as well as other urgent matters
demanding attention. The tape library office was in the house, a
normally convenient arrangement, but when I attempted to get some work
done I gradually became aware that there was something wrong with Mukti.</p>
<p>She could not leave me alone. It seemed that every five minutes she
would come down to sit on my lap, ask a question and sit on my lap, or
start an argument and end up sitting on my lap. I could not get any work
done. We would have a long talk in which I would explain the pressing
importance of my need for unbroken concentration. A few minutes later
she would cut her finger, or need help upstairs lifting something, or
want to go to bed. It just went on and on and, finally I would give up
and we would go to the beach. The next day, when I tried to work, the
pattern repeated itself.</p>
<p>I had planned to attend a three-month retreat at the Insight Meditation
Society in Barre, Massachusetts that fall. One of the things that
attracted me to Mukti was that, when I mentioned this, she said that
she, too, had been planning to attend that retreat. I had to adjust the
business to operate in my absence anyway, and after a couple of weeks of
effort, I finally managed to do so.</p>
<p>During the next two years we traveled around the world twice. Mukti
convinced me that traveling to India was more important than being
available if my mother had a serious stroke. Mukti had a thick address
book of names of wealthy devotees she had met while visiting various
gurus, and she was a master at using her association with the gurus as a
way to get invitations to stay in luxurious homes. My association with
Ram Dass also proved useful in that respect, and she taught me how to
capitalize on it. Before long I fell into her lifestyle of a
professional house guest living out of a suitcase.</p>
<p>Because of our transient lifestyle it was difficult to focus on the
quality of life we were leading. We were constantly entertaining or
being entertained as guests, and moving from place to place. We had no
particular responsibilities and promises did not have to be kept, as we
were always on the move. Mukti and I did no productive work during our
travels.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-three-month-retreat">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.2. </span>The three-month retreat</h3>
<p>Somehow we managed to arrive a month late for the three-month retreat.
The rules of the retreat were simple and strict: Total silence was to be
observed, except during interviews and talks with the teachers; there
was to be no communication with other retreatants, no sex, no drugs, no
stealing and no sentient being was to be harmed. The schedule of sitting
and walking meditation retreat began at 4:30 A.M. and ended at 10:45
P.M, There were to be no days off this schedule until the end of the
retreat in December. Mukti had told me impressive stories of her
previous meditation practice and advanced initiations, so I expected
that she would take to an intensive retreat like a duck to water.</p>
<p>She took to it more like a chicken takes to water. At the end of almost
every hour of sitting meditation she would be lying in wait for me. She
would grab my arm and lead me off to the boiler room in the basement
with an urgent need to discuss something. She was having some medical
problem, some psychic experience in her meditations, or plans had to be
made for our travels, and on and on. Those discussions in the boiler
room were strictly against the rules, and I kept reminding Mukti of
that, but in the next hour she would have a new emergency.</p>
<p>She had several exotic medical problems and was on a very special diet.
The diet was difficult for her to follow, so she got me to promise to
support her morally by following her diet. Some of our meetings in the
boiler room involved discussing the need for changes in our diet.</p>
<p>Once I had a serving of yellow tofu on my plate. Mukti mistook the tofu
for scrambled eggs that were forbidden in our diet. She was enraged at
my apparent betrayal, so in the middle of the meal she came over and
punched me very hard in the ribs. That was a rather extraordinary thing
to do at a meditation retreat in the presence of many sensitive, quiet
people.</p>
<p>It soon became apparent to the teachers that Mukti and I were having
major problems sticking to the rules of the retreat. Jack Kornfield had
us in almost every day, together or individually, to discuss our
problems, but after three weeks of trying to settle into the retreat,
the incident in the dining room was the last straw. Despite her talent,
beauty and being in line to inherit a hundred million dollars, I wanted
to end the relationship.</p>
<p>Mukti was quick to see that I had truly resolved to bail out, and for
two or three days she became a model meditator. I maintained my resolve
that our relationship was over, but seeing her settle into the retreat
opened my heart.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-clean-slate">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.3. </span>The clean slate</h3>
<p>Finally she left a note for me to meet her briefly in the boiler room
after lunch. Her manner changed from demanding insistence to being soft
and open. She confessed at great length that she now saw how out of line
she had been. She even told me about rule-breaking of which I had not
been aware. She told me that our experience and the meditation practice
had resulted in her making a complete transformation, and that she
wanted a clean slate and a fresh start on a new relationship. She had
been married four times already and now she felt that she had found a
relationship that might really work. She painted a vision of what
wonderful things we could do with her money, then she said that it was
difficult for her to meditate until we could resolve our relationship.
It was becoming difficult for me, too, so the next day we left the
retreat and checked into a hotel.</p>
</section>
<section id="our-trip-around-the-world">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.4. </span>Our trip around the world</h3>
<p>After visiting friends in Boston, we went to Texas to spend the
Christmas season with my relatives, then left the country on our first
trip around the world. We had been in Greece for about a month, visiting
Mukti’s relatives, when we received word that my mother had had a severe
stroke. We immediately returned to the United States to be with her.</p>
<p>Although it appeared that she would make a good recovery from paralysis,
that stroke seemed to affect my mother’s mind more than previous
strokes. She was convinced that Mukti and I were going to get married,
and she had been on the telephone with her friends, planning a wedding
for us.</p>
</section>
<section id="getting-married">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.5. </span>Getting married</h3>
<p>That brought up an issue that we had not resolved: Should we get
married? Although there had been a great improvement since our
experience at the meditation retreat, I could see that there were still
potential problems with our relationship. On the other hand, being
married would make traveling together easier, especially when we were
staying at monasteries in India. Mukti also said that I was the kind of
person of whom her mother would approve. If we got married and showed up
at her house with a baby in arms, her mother’s heart would open, and all
our problems would be over. From time to time Mukti had attempted to
call her mother. Sometimes her mother would talk with her-for a few
minutes, but usually she would hang up immediately when she realized it
was Mukti. I thought that was strange, but Mukti explained that her
mother was an unusually strong-willed woman. However, her plan to arrive
home with a baby seemed likely to break the ice.</p>
<p>I still could not decide about getting married, so Mukti and I called
Ram Dass and explained the situation. Ram Dass strongly recommended that
we get married, and said that he would take a 40% interest in our
marriage, Maharajji would take a 10% interest, and Mukti and I would
each have a 25% interest.</p>
<p>With assurance from my teacher that it was my spiritual work, I no
longer hesitated to get married. We quickly found a judge to marry us,
and that quieted Mother’s plans for our marriage ceremony. Then, when it
was clear that Mother had settled down and was making a good recovery,
we resumed our trip around the world.</p>
</section>
<section id="india">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.6. </span>India</h3>
<p>India was indeed an awesome and spiritual experience. We spent three
months traveling to pilgrimage cities and visiting famous gurus. I was
ill with something or another most of the time I was there and quickly
caught malaria, so when we arrived in the pilgrimage city of Hardwar I
was taken immediately to the hospital. While I was there Mukti would
stop by and visit me for a few minutes each day as she was going to see
Anandamayi Ma, one of the most famous gurus in India. I, on the other
hand, was too ill to be entertaining.</p>
<p>After a few days I was well enough to join Mukti in our hotel, I slowly
continued to recover from malaria, but I had other problems, such as
diarrhea and boils. Mukti was insistent that I should be using
traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine for my complaints and I agreed. At
one point we were staying at the Neem Kara Baba Ashram in Brindaban when
I began to develop two huge boils on my leg. I had just recovered from a
boil the size of a grapefruit that had a core with the dimensions of an
apple core. The boils were not only painful but made me feel ill from
all the toxins they created. I was becoming quite impatient with the
Ayurvedic treatments that seemed totally ineffective.</p>
<p>When it seemed that the two new boils were going to be as huge as the
first, I panicked. I finally decided that the Ayurvedic approach was not
working for me and that I was going to use Western medicine, so I began
scraping off the herbal Ayurvedic poultice with the intention of
applying antibiotics. When Mukti saw what I was doing, she became
enraged that I would break my agreement and she shouted louder and
louder at me as I proceeded. As I was about to apply the antibiotic, she
grabbed the medicine from my hand and ran outside with it. I chased
after her, caught her and wrenched the medicine from her hand. She was
screaming and crying at the top of her voice as she followed me back
into the room, trying to grab the medicine. By this time the entire
staff of the ashram had gathered outside our window. Mukti continued to
cry and then screamed that I had been beating her. I told the staff that
I had not harmed her, but she continued to insist that I had been
beating her. The staff finally left after they were satisfied that, at
least, I was not beating her then. It was especially embarrassing for me
considering my relationship with Ram Dass and the American devotees of
Maharajji.</p>
</section>
<section id="another-clean-slate">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.7. </span>Another clean slate</h3>
<p>Again I decided to end my relationship with Mukti, for it had become
obvious to me that it was more important to Mukti to control and
manipulate me than for me to be healthy. But as soon as I resolved to
end our relationship she abruptly changed. She cried for forgiveness and
admitted that she was wrong. Again she described the error of her ways
in great detail, became soft, open and asked for a clean slate to start
our relationship again. I had seen this change before, but I really
wanted to believe her. I went to the hospital for a shot of penicillin
and my boils immediately began to subside. So did the turmoil in our
relationship.</p>
<p>All went well until we returned to Santa Cruz, where Mukti wrote to her
mother to tell her that she was married again and was going to settle
down. She tried to call her, too, but had no more luck than before.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-financial-crisis">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.8. </span>The financial crisis</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, my financial situation was getting critical. I had been
spending money freely on the premise that there was a trust fund
somewhere accumulating $5,000 a month, and that it was going to be only
a matter of time before the money would be available to us. By then we
had accumulated a total of $60,000 in one year bank loans. I had been
borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, but it was getting difficult to play
that game when I owed both Peter and Paul.</p>
<p>Something had to be done immediately as we could wait no longer for
Mukti’s mother to come around. We had purchased a wide variety of items
on our trip with the idea that we could find out what kinds of things
would be best to import. I had purchased some new credit card sized
calculators in Hong Kong, thinking that it would be easy to reproduce
and print business cards on the back. The small calculators were quite a
novelty in 1979 and I thought they would make an excellent business gift
premium, so we decided to go into the business of custom imprinting
small calculators.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-other-strategy">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.9. </span>The other strategy</h3>
<p>Another strategy, as I mentioned earlier, was for Mukti to arrive on her
mother’s doorstep with a baby in her arms, but there was one problem
with that: I had had a vasectomy. Casting about, we located the nation’s
top specialist in reversing vasectomies, and he assured us that I had
excellent prospects, so we scheduled an operation.</p>
<p>There is much work to do when setting up a new business, but when I
tried to do it I discovered that Mukti’s impulse to pester me had not
subsided. She had been having increasing problems with stomach pain and
frequent vomiting, so we decided that it might be best for her to go to
the Hippocrates Institute, which specialized in a regimen of raw food
and wheat grass juice. It was one of Mukti’s favorite places. When she
left for the Hippocrates Institute I flew down to Los Angeles for my
operation.</p>
<p>The two weeks Mukti was at the Hippocrates Institute was a very
productive time for me. I established a source for small calculators,
bought and set up equipment for silk screening business cards on them,
developed direct mail advertising, and rented a mailing list. The
business was ready to go, and all that was left to do were routine
things that Mukti and I could work on together.</p>
<p>When Mukti returned from the Hippocrates Institute, she was unusually
eager for us to have sex immediately. We did, once, and immediately
after that she received a message from God saying that we were not to
have sex. This was one was frustrating, but I felt confident that this
situation would pass. In the Hindu tradition celibacy is an ideal even
for married people and since we would be in India with many Hindu
friends it seemed appropriate at that time.</p>
</section>
<section id="importing-from-india">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.10. </span>Importing from India</h3>
<p>We settled into developing our new business. Although we had a promising
start with the calculators, Mukti was not happy about it, saying that
the business was interfering with our spiritual development. What she
really wanted was to import things from India, as that would give us an
opportunity to visit the gurus when we went on buying trips.</p>
<p>We decided that the best item to import would be hand made silk rugs. I
had a good location for a rug business near the River Oaks section of
Houston, and Mukti knew many rich people all over the world. Mukti
would be the sales force, and we were confident that she would do well
selling investment quality silk rugs, so we abandoned the calculator
business and set out for a buying trip to India.</p>
<p>I knew that Mukti would want to stay on to play in India, but our
financial situation was critical. I made her promise faithfully that our
trip would be a quick one-week buying trip, and that under no
circumstances would we be gone for more than a month. Our plan was to
buy $13,000 of silk carpets on my American Express card, then we would
return and sell the rugs before lapse of the three months required for
the charges to reach us from India.</p>
<p>On our way we stopped in Texas to visit my mother, and while there Mukti
suffered a miscarriage. The doctor mentioned that the fetus was six
weeks old.</p>
<p>We continued on to India, and there we ran into a former girlfriend of
mine with whom Mukti quickly developed a close friendship. We traveled
together to Kashmir to buy carpets and then went down to Bombay, where
we learned that Anandamayi Ma and Sai Baba would be in the same city in
southern India on Anandamayr s birthday. They were the two most
prominent gurus in India, and it seemed certain that those two favorites
of Mukti’s would come together on that day. The auspicious occasion was
only a week away, but our allotted week had expired.</p>
</section>
<section id="mukti-stays-in-india">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.11. </span>Mukti stays in India</h3>
<p>We finally decided that Mukti would stay on for another week with our
friend, but before I went ahead to Houston to prepare for the big rug
sale I reminded her of her solemn pledge not to stay more than one
month, and urged her to return to the United States as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A week went by and there was no word from Mukti. A month went by and
there was no Mukti or word from Mukti. Then, finally, after six weeks, I
received a telegram from Mukti in northern India saying that she had
typhoid and was too ill to travel.</p>
<p>I felt trapped in an impossible predicament. I wanted to go to India,
but I couldn’t. Mother’s health had deteriorated and her medical bills
were now $1,700 a month more than her income, and I had to make up the
difference. I had to make over $1,000 a month in interest payments, and
bills from our travels were coming in at the rate of about $2,000 a
month. I had to make over $5,000 a month before I even could pay for
food and shelter. I could not possibly go to India, or our finances
would fall like a house of cards—and Mother was dying.</p>
<p>I contacted everyone I knew who might be going to India. Starting with
Ram Dass I sent a string of people to Mukti’s aid, but it was another
six weeks before a report arrived.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two weeks after the telegram, I finally received a telephone
call from Mukti in New Delhi. She said that she could not return because
she had lost her plane ticket, and she was still too ill to travel. She
begged me to come to India to be with her. I explained that it was
impossible for me to go to India, but that I had sent many people to
take care of her, I told her to use a credit card to buy another ticket
and return immediately, but she continued to beg me to come to India to
be with her, and then ended the call, saying that she was too ill to
continue. That was the last I heard from her for a few months.</p>
</section>
<section id="reports-from-india">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.12. </span>Reports from India</h3>
<p>Then the reports from India started to come in. Ram Dass’ letter was the
first, reporting that Mukti had returned to Hardwar and seemed in good
health and spirits. The journey from New Delhi to Hardwar is more
arduous than taking a plane from New Delhi to Houston, and that cast
doubt upon her claim that she was too ill to travel. Other reports came
in from time to time saying that she was doing well and did not need
help. One report included a relayed message that the plane ticket she
left with an agent had been sold and that she should come by and pick up
her money. So much for her excuse about not being able to return because
she had lost her ticket.</p>
<p>And then another kind of report started to arrive. Back in 1979 it took
credit charges made in India about three months to appear on statements
in America. It soon became clear that at the time Mukti claimed to be on
her death bed she was traveling almost continually to every major city
in India. The true magnitude of her lies and betrayal was starting to
dawn on me. How could someone I had totally trusted do such things to
me?</p>
</section>
<section id="the-american-express-card">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.13. </span>The American Express card</h3>
<p>I attempted to have her American Express card cancelled, but I had
signed a contract with American Express that legally obligated me to pay
any charges she made on her card. It was the same as if I had asked
American Express to cancel my card and then continued to make charges on
it. I had to pay the bill.</p>
<p>By the end of 1979, I had been forced to sell all of my income producing
assets, and I had ten thousand dollars in the bank When Mukti called me
at Christmas, while I was visiting my mother, I said some things to her
in anger. Her typical strategy when caught doing something wrong was to
counter with accusations of her own. True to form, she became angry with
me for not going to India to help her when she was ill. I made an
obvious reply to that and she hung up in a fury.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-month-in-india">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.14. </span>$20,000 a month in India</h3>
<p>That was the beginning of what was probably a record for credit card
abuse in India. For the next five months Mukti went on a charging
rampage that averaged $20,000 a month on my American Express card. India
was not accustomed to dealing with fraud of that kind. Indian merchants
rarely bothered getting authorization for charges because the telephone
system was so poor and authorization was never refused anyway. During
that time Mukti went to each of the American Express offices in India
and got the maximum of $1,000 in travelers checks despite the fact that
I was trying to get American Express to cancel my card. I told them that
I had no chance of paying her bills, and advised them where she was and
what she was doing. The charges were stopped at last, but only after she
reached Hong Kong and tried to use the card there.</p>
<p>People are amazed that it is possible to spend $20,000 a month in India.
Later Mukti admitted that it was hard work, but she proved that she had
a talent for spending money. She started in New Delhi by taking a suite
of rooms for herself and another for her boyfriend in one of the best
hotels. Then she bought plane tickets for a guru and his entourage of
twenty people and they all flew down to Bombay. There she checked into
the Taj Mahal hotel and took a suite for herself, one for her boyfriend
and a third for the guru. Meanwhile, she left the meter running on the
rooms in New Delhi. From Bombay she went to Madras and repeated her
performance. After all, she had to return to each major city every three
weeks to draw her limit of $1,000 in travelers checks from American
Express.</p>
<p>She was quite adept at drawing attention with her credit charges. For
example, she charged a $1,500 shawl that she gave to Anandamayi Ma,
which really impressed her Indian devotees. Again, when Indira Gandhi’s
son was killed in a plane crash, and she went to Anandamayi Ma for
consolation, Mukti saw a good attention-getting scene, so she rented a
white, air-conditioned Mercedes Benz, with a chauffeur and arrived at
the ashram while Indira Gandhi was there.</p>
<p>Throughout that period I was at my mother’s bedside, as it appeared that
she was close to death. But after three months her condition stabilized,
so I made a trip to California to take care of some of my possessions
there. On the way I stopped in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to visit Ram Dass
for a few days, and mentioned to him that his share of the current
month’s American Express bill was $8,000. He was silent for a few
minutes, and then said, “Is that a forty percent or fifty percent
interest I have in your marriage?” He never paid.</p>
</section>
<section id="back-after-fifteen-months">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.15. </span>Back after fifteen months</h3>
<p>I also visited another friend who was a devotee of Anandamayi Ma, and he
suggested that I write a letter to the abbot of one of her monasteries
and tell him exactly what Mukti had been doing. I did, and it worked.
Anandamayi ordered Mukti to return to me immediately, and within a month
she was back in Houston — fifteen months after she had faithfully
promised to return in one month.</p>
<p>I was prepared for her tactic of attacking when she was wrong, so when I
picked her up at the airport and she met me with an angry “Why didn’t
you come to India to be with me?” I replied with accusations of my own.
Immediately she switched from being angry to being soft and loving: “You
are right and I was very wrong. I love you. Forgive me. Give me a clean
slate and let’s start over.” She was a master and put on a good show,
but this time she had gone too far. I was determined to extricate myself
from my co-psychopathic role.</p>
<p>Mukti called her mother, and it appeared that at last she was giving in.
Her mother said she was purchasing a new house in Palm Springs,
California, and she invited Mukti to come out and see it in the
following month. At that time Mukti was staying with a friend in Carmel,
California, and was so overjoyed at the news that she put a deposit on a
million-dollar house in Carmel.</p>
<p>We agreed to a divorce and a settlement Mukti agreed to pay me $150,000,
which represented fifty percent of the decline of my net worth while we
were married, and she also agreed to pay the $150,000 in charges
remaining on my American Express account. The settlement was to be paid
on September 1, 1980, shortly before I was to start my long-delayed
three-month retreat at the Insight Meditation Society.</p>
</section>
<section id="i-stole-that">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.16. </span>“I stole that”</h3>
<p>I joined Mukti in California to separate our personal possessions that
were in storage there. First we separated our belongings in the usual
way, but when deciding who should take possession of items acquired
together Mukti would frequently say, “I stole that,” to establish her
claim to them. I was amazed at how frequently she would say this.</p>
<p>I had been vaguely aware that Mukti would pick up some merchandise from
stores and be in too much of a hurry to pay. Occasionally I would say
something to her about it and she would invariably reply, “God told me
to take it.” What appalled me was not only how frequently she said “I
stole that,” but that some items were from homes where we had stayed as
house guests. That was a sobering insight into how the mind of a
co-psychopath can rationalize and not see things that should have been
seen.</p>
</section>
<section id="another-delayed-insight">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.17. </span>Another delayed insight</h3>
<p>I had another delayed insight while we were in Santa Cruz, during an
amicable period when Mukti had agreed to make restitution in our divorce
settlement. After we had separated our personal possessions, Mukti took
me to attend a concert given by a friend whom she admired for living a
life of luxury by receiving multiple welfare payments. She said that
they had met when she was at the Hippocrates Institute. A couple of
weeks later it finally dawned on me that the last and only time I had
sex after my vasectomy reversal was one month before her miscarriage.
The fetus she miscarried was six weeks old, so she must have gotten
pregnant shortly after arriving at the Hippocrates Institute.</p>
</section>
<section id="there-are-no-limits-to-the-evil-that-a-liar-can-do">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.18. </span>There are no limits to the evil that a liar can do</h3>
<p>I had resigned as manager of the Hanuman Foundation Tape Library
when Mukti and I began our travels, but I still received some mail there
and stayed there whenever I was in California. One morning I had gone
out for breakfast. When I returned I discovered that Mukti had arrived
early for our meeting and had persuaded an employee to lend her a key to
get into the office. When I walked in, she was sitting at a desk,
talking on the telephone, with a stack of my unopened mail in front of
her.</p>
<p>A few months later I began to receive charges on a new Master Card that
must have been in my unopened mail, and in a few months they totaled
over $20,000. That was after Mukti returned from India and apologized
profusely for what she had done with my American Express card, It was
after she asked for a clean slate to start over. It was after we had
agreed to our divorce settlement. That reminded me of a saying
attributed to the Buddha, “There are no limits to the evil that a liar
can do.” That saying has come to mind often since we went our separate
ways.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I did not have to pay for any of the charges on the stolen
credit card because I never actually received it. The charges on the
American Express card were only a civil matter involving a bad debt, but
the use of a stolen card constitutes theft, a felony. Meanwhile,
American Express would not issue me a new card, and that blew my last
good line of credit.</p>

arrived, but the payment did not. I called a mutual friend in California
who told me Mukti had gone to India for one month. (We know about her
one-month trips to India.) Mukti knew that my three-month retreat
started in September, so it was especially inconsiderate of her not to
let me know what was happening. I would not know until the end of the
retreat whether I had all my bills paid and $150,000 in the bank, or no
money and $150,000 in bills that I could not pay. Meditation is
difficult enough without a situation like that.</p>
<p>My mind was in turmoil for the first ten days of the retreat, but since
I had done everything I could, I felt morally clean, and that allowed me
to break through the confusion and settle into a good retreat
experience.</p>
<p>Though I would not know my fate until Mukti returned from India, I was
not at all surprised at the end of the three months to find that she had
not returned and had left no hint of when she might do so. With my
options now severely curtailed, I chose to begin a two-year retreat as a
hermit in a remote area on the island of Maui, Hawaii.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.20. </span>Maybe there wasn’t a trust fund</h3>
<p>In the spring of 1981, while I was secluded on Maui, Mukti came through
Hawaii on her way back from India, learned of my location from friends,
and came to visit me. She told me that when she called her mother in
Palm Springs, her mother said that it would not be a good time for a
visit, and abruptly hung up. Apparently, she had reflected upon the many
clean slates and new starts that she had given Mukti, and renewed her
resolve to have nothing to do with her. I told Mukti that my attorney
and American Express could find no trace of a trust fund in her name.
“Well,” Mukti replied, “maybe there wasn’t a trust fund. All I know is
that the last check that I received from my mother was for five thousand
dollars.”</p>
<p>It turned out that the woman whom Mukti called her mother was actually
her adoptive parent. Mukti’s real parents had immigrated from Greece to
New York City when she was ten years old. They had been wealthy, but
lost their businesses. They had difficulty adjusting to a new culture
and having to work and had put a heavy strain on their marriage. Mukti
felt ignored and unloved in the new situation, and had become a problem
child. She began to spend more and more time with an old friend of the
family who had a home in New York City, a wealthy but childless lady who
proposed to adopt Mukti. Because her real parents did not know what to
do with her, and their friend offered a good opportunity for their
daughter, they were quick to accept the offer.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.21. </span>Cocaine Jane</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, Mukti continued to be a problem child with her adoptive
parents. Her new mother divorced and remarried. Perhaps her adoptive
mother, giving attention to a new husband, made Mukti feel insecure and
resentful, but in any case she did not like her new stepfather, and by
the time she turned eighteen she had left home.</p>
<p>Living off a temporary allowance, Mukti became a rock band groupie and
had a rock song written for her entitled <em>Cocaine Jane</em>. Mukti told me
many stories about how her adopted mother would try to make her change
her behavior and lifestyle. Some things she did were quite embarrassing
to her family. After several major but futile efforts to get her to
straighten out her life, she was warned that if there were not a basic
change in her behavior, she would be cut off. She didn’t, and she was.</p>

<section id="there-are-no-limits">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.22. </span>There are no limits….</h3>
<p>After my two-year retreat in Hawaii I left my truck with a friend to
sell for me, having signed the title to make the sale easy. Mukti was a
houseguest of my friend shortly after I left, and she took the
opportunity to steal the signed title, sell the truck, and keep the
money. “There are no limits to the evil that a liar can do.”</p>
<p>Ken Keyes wrote extensively about his affair with Mukti in his book,
<em>Discovering the Secrets of Happiness</em>. The yacht which she described
as her mother’s in fact belonged to Ken Keyes. This is but one example
of how she changes names and circumstances to weave a lie that has some
basis in fact. From time to time I hear reports of Mukti’s trail of
devastation and betrayal. She has changed her name several times, and
for a while lived with a plastic surgeon who changed her appearance, but
her behavior has not changed. She stole $40,000 from a lady who had
befriended and helped her often; she was caught selling food stamps and
has forged checks, but somehow managed to avoid jail; and I have heard
several rumors that people have invested in her schemes and lost their
money.</p>
<p>In 1992 I ran into Mukti at the Neem Karoli Baba Ashram in Taos, New
Mexico. She told me that the person I knew as Mukti was dead and that
she was a new person. The only difference I could detect was that the
old Mukti would have asked for a clean slate. True to form, I have heard
stories since then of the destruction and duplicity that the new Mukti
has left in her wake.</p>

<section id="saint-mukti">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.23. </span>Saint Mukti</h3>
<p>My experience with Mukti is particularly relevant to the subject of
saints and psychopaths. Mukti represented herself as being enlightened,
and indeed many people believed that she was. One of her previous
husbands was a guru, with a substantial following in the United States.
When Mukti came into contact with followers of that tradition, they
treated her with awe.</p>
<p>One of the techniques of this tradition was to be able to give
<em>shaktipat</em>. <em>Shaktipat</em> is a psychic energy a guru can administer which
has a profound effect on the recipient. <em>Shaktipat</em> can be
administered directly by a touch, or remotely in a large room, or even
in another country when the recipient is meditating. There are a variety
of experiences a recipient can have, such as falling into a deep trance,
sudden rapid, erratic breathing, energy sensations in the body, etc.
Once Mukti touched a man (from her former husband’s organization) who
was visiting us. He fell over in a brief trance and slowly recovered in
a confused, blissful state. He felt that he had been cleansed and
transformed by his experience, and was quite impressed by Mukti’s power.</p>
<p>I invited Mukti to give me <em>shaktipat,</em> but she claimed to have been
told that after having been given this power she should never use it
frivolously. She said that it should be administered only when someone
indicated certain signs of readiness for the experience, but she never
clearly explained what those signs were.</p>
<p>Although <em>shaktipat</em> may very well be a legitimate, beneficial
phenomenon used by saints and gurus, the ability to give <em>shaktipat</em>
should not be regarded as proof of anything. The experience of
<em>shaktipat</em> is similar to experiences that dubious Christian faith
healers are able to give some people. There have been some studies with
Kirlian photography which indicates that there is some kind of
transferal of energy from a healer to recipient, but there is no
explanation of what this energy is. Certainly we would not declare that
the electric eel is a divine fish because it is able to transmit a
profoundly effective energy. My view is that any strange or psychic
phenomenon should be taken at face value only and that no conclusions
should be drawn about anyone’s spiritual attainments because of their
powers. Because people usually regard the manifestation of powers as
proof of divine authority, some legitimate spiritual teachers manifest
powers to get people’s attention, but demonstrations of miracles and
powers may only prove that someone is a good illusionist or magician.</p>
<p>Mukti could also manifest psychic powers other than <em>shaktipat.</em> One
example occurred when we were unpacking after our first trip to India. I
was in the bedroom with the door closed, and I unpacked a souvenir from
a previous relationship that Mukti had asked me to throw away. I hid it
under some things in a drawer. About ten minutes later Mukti entered and
was walking across the room toward me when she suddenly stopped, turned
ninety degrees, crossed the room, opened the drawer, reached in,
directly pulled the object from the bottom, and said, “What are you
doing with this”?</p>
<p>Mukti frequently received messages from God. Sometimes the messages were
dubious, and at other times they seemed profoundly right and
appropriate. I never was convinced that they were indeed messages from
God, but while we were together I never entirely dismissed them as
fraudulent. I mentally filed those messages under the category of <em>Maybe</em>,
but they tended to manifest a self-serving pattern from Mukti’s
viewpoint.</p>
</section>
<section id="need-for-attention">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.24. </span>Need for attention</h3>
<p>Mukti was motivated by a need for attention. I suppose it was rooted in
her childhood, because her parents paid her less attention as their
family and their life of luxury and comfort fell apart. Then the change
to a new life in a new country brought her even less attention. Whatever
the cause, it seemed that she would do anything, good or bad, to get the
attention she craved.</p>
<p>As we traveled around, constantly meeting new people, I had a ring-side
seat for observing whatever she did to people. Whether a maid in a
hotel, a waitress in a restaurant, a customs official, a policeman, a
stewardess, or someone sitting next to her on a plane, they would notice
and remember her. She seemed equally inclined to do something for which
they would hate her or love her, but they would remember their encounter
with her. She would never order something from a menu, but had to
exchange or substitute items, or have something especially prepared. It
was usually easier to get attention by complaining bitterly and
excessively about the quality of food but, on occasion, she would have
ringing words of praise for food and service.</p>
</section>
<section id="trust-and-distrust">
<h3><span class="section-number">3.3.25. </span>Trust and distrust</h3>
<p>It seems that Mukti was involved in an endless cycle of trust and
distrust. It was very important to her that people keep their promises
to her. She was constantly insisting that everyone around her make all
sorts of promises to her, but became enraged whenever she felt that
anyone had not kept a promise. At the same time she seemed incapable of
keeping her own promises.</p>
<p>Mukti’s constant lies added a dimension to her cycle of trust and
distrust. One of the first things she told me about herself was that she
was a reformed pathological liar. That was her first lie to me. At times
it was a good cover for things she had done in the past that involved
lying. As with promises, she would become enraged if she suspected
anyone told her a lie, and yet she seemed incapable of telling the
truth. Many times she told me stories of events in her life, changing
the names and circumstances slightly to create a false image of what
really happened. It was puzzling to me why she would do that, as it
would have been just as easy and interesting had she told the truth.</p>
<p>On occasion I was aware that she was telling someone something that was
not true or not entirely true, yet, when confronted with the fact, she
never failed to manufacture a rationalization or explanation. It is the
nature of a co-psychopath to readily agree to improbable distortions of
reality. One of the lessons I learned as I extricated myself from my
co-psychopath role was that she had told me countless lies which I had
been unable to detect, for even though I knew she would lie to other
people, I thought I was exempt. It wasn’t until after she failed to
return from India that I became aware that she had told me many lies.</p>
