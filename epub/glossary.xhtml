<dl class="simple">
<dt>Anagami</dt><dd><p>One who has attained the third level of enlightenment. The
classic definition of an <em>Anagami</em> is that he or she has eliminated
the mental defilements of lust and aversion, but still retains the five
defilements of mind: 1) craving for subtle material realms, 2) craving
for subtle immaterial realms, 3) conceit, 4) restlessness, 5) the final
vil of unknowing or delusion.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Arahant</dt><dd><p>A fully enlightened being. One who has uprooted all the
defilements and experiences no more mental suffering. According to the
Theravada tradition, just before death an Arahant will pass into and
remain in Nirvana and will not be reborn in any form. According to the
Mahayana tradition, Arahants may be reborn if they have made a vow to
reincarnate to help other sentient beings attain enlightenment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>atta</dt><dd><p>The Hindu concept of self as being an unchanging, immutable aspect
of the consciousness of God. Enlightenment in this tradition is regarded
as a transcendence of concepts which separate oneself from God.
Ultimately, all separate self existence is relinquished, and all that
remains is everything which is God. In both the Hindu and Buddhist
tradition individual self existence ultimately ceases when one realizes
fully that the individual self is only an illusion, and when one is able
to transcend the craving which causes rebirth.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Commentaries</dt><dd><p>In the 5th century A.D. Buddhaghosa, an Indian scholar in
Sri Lanka, compiled and translated a great body of texts written
in Sinhalese and Sanskrit into Pali. The Theravadans believe Buddhaghosa
regarded the Buddha as the source of original thought, and the various
explanatory texts as fortification of the teachings of the Buddha.
Western scholars have suggested that Buddhaghosa must have simply
translated any texts that were available as they range in quality from
wonderfully insightful to trivial and erroneous. In any case, the body
of Pali texts which were compiled became the basis for making Pali the
scholarly language of the Theravada tradition in Southeast Asia.</p>
</dd>
<dt>contemplative</dt><dd><p>As used in this book, <em>contemplative</em> refers to
spiritual traditions which involve mental disciplines as opposed to
disciplines which involve service, study, teaching, or work.</p>
</dd>
<dt>co-psychopath</dt><dd><p>Co-psychopaths are close associates of psychopaths who
are caught up in a web of control and deception. They may be a spouse,
partner, student or disciple. They, themselves are usually not morally
defective, but they have accepted the artificial reality that the
psychopaths have created. Once they have developed some doubt about
their psychopathic associate, they have an excellent chance of
extricating themselves from their role. Usually to fully recover, they
will need support and understanding from others who have had similar
experiences.</p>
</dd>
<dt>deep insight</dt><dd><p>An abbreviation of <em>Deep Insight into Arising and Passing
of Phenomenon.</em> This occurs when concentration and the ability to
observe change are developed to the point that thought processes can be
observed to arise and pass in the mind. The nature of objects of
consciousness appears to change, and a great energy and enthusiasm for
meditation practice arises in the meditator. After deep insight, insight
into faster and subtler components of the thought process is realized,
and the meditator acquires an intuitive wisdom about the nature of
consciousness and reality.</p>
</dd>
<dt>defilements of mind</dt><dd><p>There are three basic defilements of the mind:
greed, hatred-aversion, and delusion-confusion-unknowing. There are
innumerable individual defilements which are permutations and
combinations of the basic three such as: fear, sloth, conceit, jealousy,
paranoia and resentment. The root cause of defilements is craving, or a
strong preference for things to be a certain way such as, having what
you want and not having an experience which you do not want. The mind is
defiled when there is craving that is unconscious and determines
behavior. Only Arahants are able to be conscious of the arising of the
subtlest forms of craving.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Dhammapada</dt><dd><p>The <em>Dhammapada</em> was compiled in Sri Lanka about 2,000
years ago from the 100,000 page record of the Buddha’s discourses.
Occasionally during his discourses, the Buddha would make a point in
spontaneous poetry. The <em>Dhammapada</em> is an anthology of some of these
poems. Since the record of the discourses are chants of summaries, and
since the poems could not be rendered into summaries, the <em>Dhammapada</em>
contains the purest record of what the Buddha actually said.</p>
</dd>
<dt>dharma</dt><dd><p>The natural law for any conditioned object. The truth. The
teachings of the Buddha. Cause and effect. The way things are. Dharma is
Sanskrit for the Pali word <em>dhamma.</em> It has a great range of
meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Usually it
applies to spiritual truths or laws. Sometimes it is used as a synonym
for karma which is one aspect of the dharma. Generally, <em>dharma</em>
refers to the natural law or the basic truth such as the law of
gravity (also a dharma), and it is not strictly speaking a law, but the
definition of a process. Dharma is not regarded in Buddhism as a law
decreed by the Buddha or any deity.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Eight Fold Path</dt><dd><p>The Buddha’s basic teaching is the Eight Fold Path. It
consists of eight things which if understood and done correctly will
lead to enlightenment. They are: Right Understanding, Right Thought,
Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right
Mindfulness, Right Concentration. All of the Buddha’s teachings are
explanations and elaborations on these eight basic teachings.</p>
</dd>
<dt>enlightenment</dt><dd><p>As used in this book, refers to having attained a stable
access to the first stratum of the unconscious processes and corresponds
to the level of stream-winner. The characteristics of clarity,
compassion and intuitive wisdom deepen as access to deeper strata are
attained. Arahants have the greatest access and are regarded as being
fully enlightened.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>karma</em></dt><dd><p>Karma is the cause and effect relationship of how past
actions condition our present experience. Karma is created by the
volitional intentions of action, speech and thought and the effect they
have on sentient beings. One’s reality is the result of one’s karma and
is a composite of good and bad karma. Good karma results in pleasure.
Bad karma results in suffering. Actions based on intentions to bring
pleasure result in good karma. Actions based on intentions to bring harm
bring suffering. Actions which result in good karma do not cancel out
bad karma, but they do upgrade the mix.</p>
</dd>
<dt>LSD</dt><dd><p>A powerful psychedelic drug, lysergic acid diethylamide, that alters
consciousness and perception.</p>
</dd>
<dt>levels of enlightenment</dt><dd><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><em>Sotapanna</em>; 2) <em>Sakadagami</em>; 3) <em>Anagami</em>; 4) <em>Arahant.</em></p></li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt><em>Mahasatipatthana</em></dt><dd><p>A long discourse by the Buddha in the <em>Digha
Nikayti</em> describing the basic principles of meditation and different
forms of meditation practice. It is traditionally regarded as being a
single discourse given in the market town of Karnmasadhamma. However, a
study of the structure and content of the text indicates it was
compilation on the subject of meditation from fragments of various
discourses. The editor’s apparent lack of skill in meditation seem to
have created some odd combinations of topics based on words instead of
how methods would be used in actual practice. It seems unlikely that a
skillful teacher such as the Buddha would arrange his topics in such a
way. It is possible that the Buddha expected that the details of
meditation practice be taught individually and orally by a qualified
teacher. This may be why his discourses contain so little specific
information on meditation technique.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mahayana</dt><dd><p>Buddhists who take the Bodhisattva Vow to delay their
enlightenment until all sentient beings attain enlightenment. The
purpose is to remain in existence so that they can help to all other
sentient beings attain enlightenment. Mahayana Buddhists have different
interpretations of what this vow means, but many regard this as not
entering <em>Parinirvana</em> where individual existence would cease. In the
Mahayana tradition it is believed that the Bodhisattva vow makes it
possible to override the limitations of rebirth that the Buddha
described for different levels of enlightenment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>metta</dt><dd><p>A meditation practice of systematically cultivating feelings of
unconditional loving kindness. <em>Metta</em> is a concentration practice
sometimes used in conjunction with, but not at the same time as
<em>vipassana</em> meditation. <em>Metta</em> is a wish that all beings should be
safe, happy and healthy. Advanced practitioners experience heavenly
mental states, and sometimes have a profound positive effect on other
beings.</p>
</dd>
<dt>nama-rupa</dt><dd><p>Mind and matter. A stage of development in meditation
practice when it becomes very clear that mind and matter are separate
but interdependent.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Nirvana</dt><dd><p>Sanskrit: lit, <em>Extinction</em> (nir+va to cease blowing, to
become extinguished.) Nirvana is beyond time and space; therefore it has
neither beginning nor end—birth nor death. One can enter into Nirvana
and leave it, but Nirvana is always there and unchanging. The ultimate
objective of Buddhism is to enter Nirvana and not leave it. Some of the
synonyms the Buddha used for are Nirvana are: The Peaceful State,
Deathless, Bliss Supreme, Stilling of Conditioned Things, Unconditioned,
Uncreated, Unmade, Unoriginated, Unformed, Unborn, Uncompounded, The
Way, Highest Goal, Fruit, Dharma, Happiness Supreme, That Beyond
Happiness, Destruction of Conditioned Things, Gone Beyond. Nirvana is
experienced briefly at the culmination of each path at the time that
enlightenment or higher level of enlightenment is attained. Since there
are no reference points in Nirvana to base a description
on, any description of Nirvana is not a description of
Nirvana.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Non-returner</dt><dd><p>An Anagami. People who have attained the third level of
enlightenment The Buddha gave them the name <em>Non-returners</em> because
they will not be reborn again in this world as a human. They will
experience one more birth in a formless heavenly realm of gods before
they go into <em>Parinirvana.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Pali</dt><dd><p>Summaries of the Buddha’s discourses were rendered into chants, and
for two hundred years after the death of the Buddha, nearly the only
record of what the Buddha said, was this oral tradition. Then King Asoka
sponsored the writing of the Buddha’s discourses into Pali, the language
of his kingdom. Northern India was ruled by the kingdom of Magadha
during the Buddha’s lifetime, so it seems reasonable that the Buddha
spoke Magadhi in public, and possibly at times spoke Sanskrit with
scholars. Both Magadhi and Pali have very near roots in Sanskrit. The
similarity of the three languages must have the advantage of
transmitting subtle understanding as well as subtle misunderstandings.
Traditionally, the Theravada view is that Pali is an absolutely accurate
record of the Buddha’s discourses, and the Pali Commentaries are
accurate elaborations of the Buddha’s teachings.</p>
</dd>
<dt>parinirvana</dt><dd><p>Immediately before physical death, an Arahant’s
consciousness passes out of conditioned existence and enters into
Nirvana, and will not reenter conditioned existence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>progress of insight</dt><dd><p>The sequence of insights leading up to
enlightenment and immediately after enlightenment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>psychedelic</dt><dd><p>Of alterations in consciousness or perceptions. From the
Greek psyche (mind) + delos (clear). Psychedelic drugs have an effect of
creating a sense that the mind is seeing clearer and consciousness is
expanded. In larger doses, they have an increased effect of distorting
perceptions, confusing the mind and causing hallucinations. In some
cases, psychedelic drugs have induced a profound examination of the
present moment, and have resulted in <em>deep insight.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Saint</dt><dd><p>A person considered to be holy and worthy of veneration. As used
in this book, it is someone who has purified their consciousness of
defilements and is enlightened.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sakadagami</dt><dd><p>Also known as a Once-returner. Someone who has reached the
second level of enlightenment. Traditionally, a <em>Sakadagami</em> is said
to have reduced the defilements of mind of lust and aversion. A
<em>Sakadagami</em> has greater clarity of mind and a deeper intuitive wisdom
than a stream-winner.</p>
</dd>
<dt>shaktipat</dt><dd><p>The transmission of psychic energy from teacher to student
that results in a variety of phenomenon, such as deep trance, visions,
energy sensations and uncontrollable body motions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Samatha</dt><dd><p>Pure concentration meditation practice. <em>Samatha</em> meditation
is essentially a form of self-hypnosis. The mind is focused on a fixed
object which seems more solid, real and unchanging as concentration
deepens. As one is able to focus the mind precisely on the object
of concentration with less wavering to other objects or thoughts,
specific levels of concentration called <em>jhanas</em> are attained. Any
sense object—sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or thought—can be used as
an object of <em>samatha</em> meditation. Sensations of breathing are
frequently used as objects of meditation in <em>vipassana</em> practice
because the breath is a changing object. <em>Samatha</em> is an essential
component to <em>vipassana</em> and is developed first. True <em>vipassana</em>
practice begins to develop when the level of <em>nama-rupa</em> is
reached. <em>Vipassana</em> deconditions the hypnotic state of mind which
results in an illusory view of reality. One of the reasons that
vipassana meditation is so difficult is that <em>samatha</em> is constantly
being destroyed by <em>vipassana.</em></p>
</dd>
<dt>Self</dt><dd><p>In the Hindu tradition, the true self is the <em>atta</em> which is an
unchanging aspect of the consciousness of God. The objective of Hindu
practice is to come to the full realization that the <em>atta</em> is the
true self and the relinquishment of any sense that you are anything else
but the <em>atta.</em> Most Westerners do not have this concept of <em>atta</em>,
but because of unawareness, there is a natural tendency to view the
self as being in control and unchanging. As <em>vipassana</em> meditation
develops, the meditator comes to see that the self is the result of
cause and effect processes, and has no solid continuous existence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sotapanna</dt><dd><p>A Stream-winner.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sutta</dt><dd><p>Lit. a seat. The Buddha would sit and give a discourse, and after
it, a senior monk would compose a chant which was a summary of what the
Buddha had said. Monks and nuns still spend a considerable amount of
time reciting these chants in groups. The chanting is a combination of
concentration meditation and education</p>
</dd>
<dt>Stream-winner</dt><dd><p>One who has attained the first level of enlightenment.
Defilements uprooted are: Doubt that the Eightfold Path will lead to
total purification of the mind, belief that rites and rituals will
result in enlightenment, and belief in the usual sense of self. In this
book I define a <em>Stream-winner</em> as one who has permanently accessed
the first stratum of the unconscious mind.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Theravada</dt><dd><p>Thera means elder, and vada is the way of, so it is literally
the way of the elders. The Theravadans regard the Pali record of the
Buddha’s discourses, which were written two hundred years after the
Buddha, and the Pali Commentaries, compiled by Buddhaghosa a thousand
years after the time of the Buddha, as the only valid version of the
Buddha’s teaching. The roots of the Theravada tradition comes from King
Asoka who sponsored the writing of the Buddha’s discourses in Pali.
Since Asoka richly patronized Buddhist monasteries, it became necessary
to clearly define which traditions were true Buddhists and which were
false. The Theravada tradition existed along with other traditions of
Buddhism in India for a thousand years, but all forms of Buddhism were
eliminated in India by Muslim invaders. However, King Asoka’s son, who
was a monk and his daughter, who was a nun, established the Theravada
tradition in Sri Lanka which survived and has spread throughout
Southeast Asia.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>Vipassana</em></dt><dd><p>To see clearly with great penetration and effort. When
objects of consciousness are seen with enough penetrating awareness,
they will be seen as being in a continuous state of change, because
consciousness is continuously changing.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Zen</dt><dd><p>A branch of Mahayana Buddhism which was brought into China by
Bodhidarma. From China it spread into Korea and Japan. Zen evolved and
became deeply integrated with Chinese culture before it acquired many of
the texts and traditions of older forms of Buddhism. A significant
difference is that Zen monks follow a different set of rules than the
ones prescribed by the Buddha for monks. The emperors of China placed
great importance on acquiring more of the Buddha’s discourses and
rewarded people who acquired them. Some of the books of discourses
acquired have similar titles but different contents than older versions.</p>
