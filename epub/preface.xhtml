<h1><span class="section-number">2. </span>Preface</h1>
<p>There are more psychopaths pretending to be saints than there are real
saints. This book will provide you with some understanding of what a
psychopath is, what a saint is and how to tell the difference. It is
also a sharing of what I have found in my search for inner-peace and for
ways to develop my unrealized potential.</p>
<p>Some paths I followed were more like stepping stones which went part of
the way, but became obstacles to further progress. Some of these paths
were offered by sincere teachers, and others were paths of entrapment
offered by psychopaths. I learned something from all my spiritual
teachers, if only that some teachers and teachings should be avoided. I
hope that sharing my experiences will provide you with some guidelines
for avoiding similar mistakes, while encouraging you on your own
spiritual quest.</p>
<section id="my-spiritual-journey">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.1. </span>My spiritual journey</h2>
<p>My spiritual journey began in 1971. I was then the president of a
national franchise company after having a meteoric rise from being a
stock broker in the early 1960’s. I purchased a small business from a
customer, who was dying of cancer in 1964 and parlayed it into several
other small businesses. In 1965 I resigned as a stock broker to devote
all my time to my growing business empire. Everyone marveled at how
successful I had become, and it seemed assured that I had a great
future.</p>
<p>In 1971 I was given some LSD and some good advice on how to make use of
it. I was told that I should make a firm decision not to go outside my
apartment or answer my phone for 12 hours after I had taken the drug. It
was suggested that I do some inspirational reading and listen to
inspirational music for the hour or so it would take for full effect</p>
<p>I neither recommend nor discourage people from experimenting with
psychedelic drugs. Although they rarely mention it, many of the best
Western spiritual teachers today began their spiritual evolution with
psychedelics. Most people who try them simply have pleasant, unpleasant
or confusing experiences. Although only a minority of people who
experimented with psychedelics had beneficial spiritual experiences,
there were millions who experimented with them from the mid 1960’s to
mid 1970’s. During this time, most of the people who became involved
with meditation or who took spiritual journeys to Asia did so as a
result of their experiences with psychedelics. This is rarely the case
today. It seems that the drug experiences only showed that there were
possibilities of altered states of consciousness. Today we have the
results of the quests for inspiration.</p>
<p>My first experience with LSD was profound. During it, I had two insights
that changed the course of my life. One insight was a transcendent
experience of time and space, during which I briefly touched the stream
of my unconscious mind. This was the basic seed that inspired my
spiritual journey.</p>
<p>The other insight was an awareness that, as I had become outwardly more
successful, I was becoming inwardly more uptight and unhappy. Suddenly I
saw that all my personal relationships revolved around money. People
associated with me because they expected me to invest in schemes, lend,
or give them money. I could offer jobs, buy services or merchandise and
provide money making opportunities. I saw that I had cultivated
unsatisfactory motives in people around me and that I lacked truly
wholesome personal relationships.</p>
<p>At the time that I came to these realizations, I was in the middle of
developing a public offering of my company’s stock. If I had continued
with this process for another three to five years, I could have made a
twelve-million-dollar profit on my stock. However, it now seemed to me
that making such a large amount of money would sabotage the type of
relationship I would like to have with people. I soon began a process of
divesting myself of business responsibilities. Within five months, I had
found a new president for my company and set out on a full time
spiritual quest.</p>
<p>I founded the Orphalese Foundation and gathered a group consisting
mostly of psychologists who were interested in creating an intentional
community dedicated to developing human potential. We did not feel that
we had all the answers, but we felt confident that we could find and
share answers. We had a 30-room house in Denver and a 123-acre retreat
in the mountains. We explored a wide variety of practices from yoga and
meditation to theories of human potential and cosmic consciousness. As
with the vast majority of intentional community experiments popular at
that time, our group became the victim of greed, aversion and delusion.
We could say the same words as to how the goals of our community were
also our individual goals, but the words had selfish individual
meanings. After two years our group disintegrated, and we went our
separate ways.</p>
</section>
<section id="ram-dass">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.2. </span>Ram Dass</h2>
<p>During the final phase of our groups’ disintegration, I discovered the
book <em>Be Here Now</em> by Ram Dass. I was particularly inspired by the
audio tapes of his talks. I could identify with his stories of
experiments with LSD at Harvard in the early sixties when he was Dr.
Richard Alpert working with Dr. Timothy Leary. At first they thought
they had discovered a way to attain enlightenment, but after five years
Dr. Alpert decided that drugs were a dead end. After abandoning drugs as
a path, he went to India and found his guru who gave him the name <em>Baba
Ram Dass</em>. He felt that his guru offered the answer to what he said
was, “whatever it was I was looking for.”</p>
<p>Although Ram Dass did not claim to be enlightened, he did describe
himself as a seeker offering what he found on the path to enlightenment.
Since he said that Westerners were generally not welcome in the place he
had found in India, I began a daily routine of the various practices he
had described in his books and tapes.</p>
<p>The practices were primarily those of Raja Yoga—a combination of
traditional Hindu practices such as study, reflection, breathing
exercises, hatha yoga, morality and meditation, which could result in a
profound transformation. I was quite impressed with the results I was
getting from these methods, and it seemed that I was on the right track.
As the community of the Orphalese Foundation was disintegrating, I was
becoming more involved with Ram Dass and Raja Yoga.</p>
</section>
<section id="distributing-audio-tapes">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.3. </span>Distributing audio tapes</h2>
<p>I wrote to Ram Dass about the high cost of his tapes limiting
their availability to many people. I had a meeting with him and ended up
being responsible for the distribution of his tapes through the
Orphalese Foundation. Later, when the Hanuman Foundation was formed in
1974, the tapes were turned over to this new organization and I
continued to be manager of this project. My work with the tapes and Ram
Dass provided many contacts that became sources for this book.</p>
<p>I was raised as a Christian, but Christianity did not offer all the
answers that I was seeking. Ram Dass had been raised as a Jew, but he
went beyond Judaism because it was not providing the answers he sought.
While I was with Ram Dass, I experienced an eclectic smorgasbord of
spiritual traditions and techniques. Ultimately, I found that among the
Eastern traditions, the Buddhist meditation he introduced me to is the
most beneficial form of practice and, the Buddhist Philosophy is most in
tune with Western culture.</p>
</section>
<section id="buddhist-vipassana-meditation">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.4. </span>Buddhist vipassana meditation</h2>
<p>After I left Ram Dass and the Hanuman Foundation in 1977, I gradually
increased my emphasis on Buddhist <em>Vipassana</em> Meditation. In 1980 I
did my first three-month retreat at the Insight Meditation Society (IMS)
in Barre, Massachusetts. The teachers there were Western laypeople who
had spent years studying Buddhism and practicing meditation in Asia.
They intended to establish a new Western style of Buddhism almost
without rites, rituals, or dogma, which emphasized the practice of
meditation as its main feature. The method of meditation they taught was
developed by Mahasi Sayadaw, who was the preeminent Buddhist meditation
teacher in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>I was inspired enough by the results of my three-month retreat to
continue this practice for two years as a hermit in a remote area on
Maui, Hawaii, Although I was in a remote undeveloped area, soon after I
started my retreat, a stupa of enlightenment was built on the land next
to my retreat. The stupa brought me into contact with Tibetan Buddhists,
but my practice continued in the Theravada Buddhist tradition. I gained
a deep appreciation for the Tibetan tradition during this two-year
retreat.</p>
<p>People who made pilgrimages to the stupa would learn that there was a
Buddhist meditator nearby, and when I was not doing intensive practice,
I accepted visitors. Gradually, I was becoming established as a teacher,
but I felt that I had much to learn. I could have continued my retreat
indefinitely as a caretaker of the land that I was on, but I felt that I
should go to Asia to learn more about teaching.</p>
<p>After two years, I returned to IMS intending to do six months of
volunteer staff work before going on to Burma. It turned out that I
could not get into Burma because of the political turmoil there. IMS was
also going through a painful period of crisis because the social
structure of the staff was virtually dysfunctional. Because of my
background in tape recordings, a unique role of being quasi-staff,
quasi-meditator was created for me. I founded the IMS Tape Library that
later evolved into the Dharma Seed Tape Library. I had my own private
office at IMS in which I could work quietly and meditatively, mostly
isolated from the turmoil of the regular staff. I also did five hours of
intensive meditation every day.</p>
<p>After managing the IMS Tape library for a year, the Board of Directors
gave me a one year full meditation scholarship in 1984. It was a good
time to be on retreat at IMS because four great Asian meditation masters
taught there that year: Anagarika Munindra, Dipa Ma Barua, Tungpulu
Sayadaw and Sayadaw U Pandita. I had heard endless stories about
Munindra and Dipa Ma as they had been primary teachers of most of my
Western teachers. Tungpulu Sayadaw was widely regarded as being fully
enlightened. U Pandita was the successor to the late Mahasi Sayadaw, and
was regarded as the leading authority on this method of practice. U
Pandita turned out to be an incredibly powerful teacher, and has been
the greatest influence in my developing an advanced meditation practice.</p>
<p>After the full IMS scholarship expired, I was able to continue my
practice with a partial scholarship from IMS, grants from a private
foundation and gifts from several friends. Finally, after being on
retreat for almost five years, I decided to return to the real world. I
spent eighteen months traveling all over the United States doing odd
jobs and teaching meditation. During this period, my teacher Sayadaw U
Pandita taught a ten-day retreat in California, which I attended.</p>
<p>I thought that I had learned the lesson that there is no particular time
standard for how the practice unfolds. I expected that the purpose of a
trifling ten-day retreat in 1986 was to renew old acquaintances and
brush up on my meditation practice. I was surprised that this ten-day
retreat turned out to be one of the pivotal experiences of my life. As
soon as I could fulfill my teaching commitments after this retreat, I
returned to IMS for another year and a half of intensive practice.</p>
</section>
<section id="peace-pilgrim">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.5. </span>Peace Pilgrim</h2>
<p>During this retreat, a Tibetan monk visiting IMS did a reading from the
Peace Pilgrim book. After reading the book, I became convinced that
Peace Pilgrim was a rare case of spontaneous enlightenment that Buddhist
texts refer to. She seemed to conform to the Buddhist concept about
these cases: she was an inspiring teacher, but she lacked a complete
methodology for guiding others to the same attainment she had made.
Peace Pilgrim died in 1981, and some followers had compiled the Peace
Pilgrim book from transcripts of her talks, newsletters, and letters.</p>
<p>What particularly inspires me about the Friends of Peace Pilgrim, the
nonprofit organization distributing her book, was that they give books,
audio and video tapes away free. Anyone writing to Friends of Peace
Pilgrim, 43480 Cedar Ave., Hemet, CA 92544 and requesting the Peace
Pilgrim book will receive a free copy. They rely only on unsolicited
donations to continue the distribution of Peace Pilgrim’s message. Peace
Pilgrim believed that spiritual teachings should never be sold. This is
an ideal in the Buddhist tradition followed in Asia, but no one had been
successful with free distribution in the West. For years I had been
trying, without success, to figure out how to distribute audio tapes for
free.</p>
<p>At the end of my retreat in 1988, I went to Hemet, California to do one
year of volunteer work for the Friends of Peace Pilgrim. I did this
partly to support the teachings of Peace Pilgrim, but also to learn how
to do free distribution of spiritual teachings. I learned that it could
be done when free facilities are provided and the volunteers have
independent incomes.</p>
</section>
<section id="insight-recordings">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.6. </span>Insight Recordings</h2>
<p>In 1989 I returned to teaching vipassana meditation in different parts
of the United States. In 1990 I gave up teaching in order to found
Insight Recordings that distributed audio tapes of Buddhist teachers. I
took a one year sabbatical in 1993 to do volunteer work for the
Vipassana Support Institute and to do a period of intensive practice
with Sayadaw U Pandita in Burma. The retreat in Burma brought my total
time spent in intensive meditation retreat to over seven and a half
years. When I returned from my sabbatical, I found Insight Recordings in
a dysfunctional state. Since I felt that the best service I could do was
to write, I shut down Insight Recordings and put its equipment in
storage.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-life-is-my-message">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.7. </span>My life is my message</h2>
<p>I have included the details from my personal melodrama in this preface
so that you can have some understanding of the bias of my view. Also, I
have been inspired by a quotation from Mahatma Gandhi. Once when Gandhi
was boarding a train, a reporter asked Gandhi to give a message to the
people of his city. Gandhi replied, “My life is my message”. In this
book I have intertwined the message of my life with the messages of many
different religious traditions.</p>
<p>I find that identifying myself precisely in religious terms is difficult
and paradoxical. I consider myself a Christian who finds great value and
truth in the teachings of Jesus. What we know of Jesus and his teachings
gives me a strong suspicion that he was enlightened. I see strong
evidence that contemplative Christian practices have resulted in a few
people attaining enlightenment, and this reaffirms my Christian
tradition. I separate with Christians who believe that an experience or
rites and rituals can assure eternal salvation. I share the Buddha’s
view that eternal salvation comes only from purifying our consciousness
from greed, hatred and delusion. I see strains of purity and true
understanding in Christianity that I can identify with.</p>
<p>At the same time, I have difficulty identifying with many aspects of the
Buddhist tradition. Enlightenment has been defined in part as a
disbelief in rites and rituals, but Buddhism has evolved a plethora of
them. Buddhists believe in previous incarnations of the Buddha where
moral values are exemplified, in my view, in improbable fairy tales. One
of my teachers believed I should not have a buddha statue in my room
because the buddha statue would see dirty, filthy parts of my body if I
undressed in front of it. Buddhists can be fundamental and dogmatic in
their beliefs and negative about other Buddhist traditions and other
religions. Often good Buddhists believe that Buddhism (and possibly only
their particular tradition) has a monopoly on enlightenment</p>
<p>Despite these reservations, I find difficulty disassociating myself from
the Buddhists. Enlightenment is very clearly of central importance in
Buddhism. Logic and personal experiences are officially stated by the
Buddha as being more important than dogmatic belief, scriptures or any
authority. At his death, the Buddha refused to appoint a successor
saying that everyone should be a light unto themselves. The Buddhists,
by far, have the most extensive and systematic understanding of what
enlightenment is and how to attain it.</p>
<p>Joseph Campbell once said, “God is like a computer and religions are
like programs.” “All the programs work” He discretely did not mention
that, as with computer programs, some work much more efficiently than
others. Also, different programs are intended to do different things.
Although I don’t particularly think of myself as a Buddhist, I have
noticed that when I explain concepts to people, I invariably use the
Buddhist program. Today, when I seek teachings and guidance in
meditation, I look for a Buddhist teacher. I am using the WordPerfect
computer program to write this. I must be a Buddhist as well as a
WordPerfectist.</p>
</section>
<section id="enlightenment">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.8. </span>Enlightenment</h2>
<p>In this book, I take an eclectic view of enlightenment from many
different religious traditions. However, my area of expertise is in the
Buddhist tradition, and when I describe details of a saint’s evolution I
use the Buddhist model. A couple of the people who read earlier drafts
of this book completely missed the point that when I discuss the process
of evolution in the meditation practice, I am describing the Buddhist
view of the evolution of a saint. Many people who are qualified to judge
the relationship between Buddhism and Christianity have concluded that
there is an essential relationship between enlightenment and saints.</p>
<p>Enlightenment is emerging from being a vague experience of Eastern
mysticism. It is becoming a scientifically verified, quantified and
qualified experience as it enters Western culture. In the past, when
Buddhism entered new cultures, enlightenment eventually became the
highest ideal of the culture, and perhaps even a fad. It could happen
again.</p>
<p>If it does, there will be an abundance of false teachings and teachers
that will go along with it. This is why I chose to write on the subject
of Saints and Psychopaths. I want to share my experiences to help others
avoid the mistakes I made. Also, I want to make a clear statement, in
Western terms, as to what enlightenment is, in order to help people
determine which teachers and teachings are leading to freedom and which
are leading to slavery.</p>
