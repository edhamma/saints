<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.1. </span>What is a saint?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-saint" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>I previously defined a saint as a spiritual seeker who, through a
process of study, discipline, prayer, or meditation has attained a
purification of mind and true spiritual understanding. Now I am refining
this definition to say that saints are enlightened. In this chapter I
will be defining enlightenment from the viewpoint of different religious
traditions, scientific research, psychological theory and from the
viewpoint of the Buddhist tradition.</p>
<p>By defining saints as enlightened, I am excluding some saints from
different traditions whose sanctity is based on miracles, or as being
special authorities representing God. For example, I am being more
restrictive than the definition of a saint by the Catholic church. A
purpose of certification of saints by the Catholic church is to assure
people that their prayers to saints are received by angels in heaven who
can intercede on their behalf. The bases for canonization
(certification) include such things as three verified miracles and
review by church scholars, etc., but the standard does not include
enlightenment. Certainly it seems that some canonized Catholic saints are
enlightened, but there is no guarantee that all are. On the other hand,
traditional Buddhists regard Buddhism as having a monopoly on
enlightenment, and this does not seem to be true.</p>
<p>All major religious traditions have some saints, prophets, founders, or
authorities who seem to have been enlightened. Most religions have some
literature which touches on this subject, but the Buddhists, by far,
have the best technical understanding of enlightenment. They not only
have a clear systematic analysis of what enlightenment is, but also they
have a comprehensive system for attaining it that works. At the same
time, understanding the views of other traditions gives a richer
understanding than Buddhism alone provides. It is the contemplatives
from different religious traditions who can provide us with this link of
understanding.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.2. </span>The Snowmass Contemplative Group<a class="headerlink" href="#the-snowmass-contemplative-group" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the early 1980’s Father Thomas Keating, a Catholic priest, sponsored
a meeting of contemplatives from many different religions. The group
represented a few Christian denominations as well as Zen, Tibetan,
Islam, Judaism, Native American &amp; Nonaligned. They found the meeting
very productive and decided to have annual meetings. Each year they have
a meeting at a monastery of a different tradition, and share the daily
practice of that tradition as a part of the meetings. The purpose of the
meetings was to establish what common understandings they had achieved
as a result of their diverse practices. The group has become known as
the Snowmass Contemplative Group because the first of these meetings was
held in the Trappist monastery in Snowmass, Colorado.</p>
<p>When scholars from different religious traditions meet, they argue
endlessly about their different beliefs. When contemplatives from
different religious traditions meet, they celebrate their common
understandings. Because of their direct personal understanding, they
were able to comprehend experiences which in words are described in many
different ways. The Snowmass Contemplative Group has established seven
Points of Agreement that they have been refining over the years:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The potential for enlightenment is in every person.</p></li>
<li><p>The human mind cannot comprehend ultimate reality, but ultimate
reality can be experienced.</p></li>
<li><p>The ultimate reality is the source of all existence.</p></li>
<li><p>Faith is opening, accepting &amp; responding to ultimate reality.</p></li>
<li><p>Confidence in oneself as rooted in the ultimate reality is the
necessary corollary to faith in the ultimate reality.</p></li>
<li><p>As long as the human experience is experienced as separate from the
ultimate realty it is subject to ignorance, illusion, weakness and
suffering.</p></li>
<li><p>Disciplined practice is essential to the spiritual journey, yet
spiritual attainment is not the result of one’s effort but the
experience of oneness with ultimate reality.</p></li>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.3. </span>Contemplatives and enlightenment<a class="headerlink" href="#contemplatives-and-enlightenment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Contemplatives from different traditions generally agree that there is a
transforming experience they agree to call enlightenment. They agree
that enlightenment is attained as a result of controlling the mind with
various forms of practice. Usually these forms of practice are done in a
simplified protected environment where practitioners are freed from
worldly concerns to direct their attention inward. The practices may
involve body motions or body sensations, sight or focusing the vision on
particular objects, an awareness of certain outer or inner sounds,
focusing on the sense of taste or smell, observing the processes of the
mind or controlling the processes of the mind with prayer, mantra,
reflection or meditation. The common denominator of these practices is
that they focus consciousness on a sense door (Buddhists include the
mind as a sense), and the result is a profound examination of the
present moment.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that enlightenment is a progressive series of
experiences or understandings with sudden dramatic breakthroughs or peak
experiences. The methods used to induce enlightenment have a great
effect on the type of objective experiences contemplatives have. Even
within particular traditions using identical techniques, the objective
experience individuals have vary greatly. For example, at a particular
stage of development some people have visions, and others using the same
method do not. Despite the wide variety of objective experiences that
people report, teachers with extensive experience can identify the
essential common denominators. Regardless of the tradition, method and
individual experience, the result of enlightenment, in terms of wisdom
and relief from personal suffering, are identical. The wisdom and
reduced suffering are the result of a change in perceptual thresholds
which allow access to previously unconscious mental processes.</p>
</section>
<section id="perceptual-thresholds">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.4. </span>Perceptual thresholds<a class="headerlink" href="#perceptual-thresholds" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>By focusing the mind in a profound examination of the present moment,
processes of the mind which were not accessible to normal consciousness
become conscious. Unconscious processes become conscious processes.
Enlightenment is a particularly good term for this process. It is like
turning a light on in a dark room so that which was unseen becomes seen.
Regardless of which sense object is used—sight, sound, smell, taste,
touch, or processes of the mind itself—the object becomes a projection
screen for observing the fundamental processes of consciousness.</p>
<p>Research done by Dr. Daniel Brown and Dr. Jack Engler of Harvard
University gives us an understanding of one of the factors involved in
enlightenment. Their work is reported in the book <em>Transformations of
Consciousness</em> by Wilber, Engler, &amp; Brown. Brown and Engler did
scientific studies of psychological characteristics before and after
enlightenment. Part of their studies involved changes in perceptual
thresholds as a result of <em>vipassana</em> meditation. <em>Vipassana</em>
meditation is a Buddhist practice, and their studies were done
primarily at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Mass.</p>
<p>The perceptual thresholds are levels where subtle or fast processes can
be observed. Below the threshold the process is not observed, and above
the threshold the process is observed. A tachistoscope or T-scope is an
instrument that can present visual displays at rates of thousandths of a
second. The T-scope has been used to determine what humans are capable
of becoming aware of at the level prior to conscious attention. Brown’s
experiments involved determining how slow objects needed to be flashed,
before the subjects were able to perceive them as two separate events.
The smallest gap of time between the two events an individual is capable
of perceiving the change is that individual’s threshold. Just as IQ will
vary among different people, perceptual thresholds vary. Scientists had
concluded in 40 years of research before Brown’s work that a threshold
for any particular person did not change in a lifetime.</p>
<p>However, Brown’s research produced a startling new finding. After
3-months of <em>vipassana</em> meditation his subjects had significantly
lower perceptual thresholds. They were able to perceive much faster and
subtler events than before the retreat. The changes were not small
changes but big changes. Changes were frequently 100%, 200%, 500%. One
friend of mine had an increase of 1,500%.</p>
<p>The results of Brown’s research give a scientific basis for
understanding the results of meditation practice. By focusing the mind
in a profound examination of the present moment, processes of the mind
which were not accessible to normal consciousness become conscious.
These processes are beyond the perceptual threshold of the normal
person.</p>
<p>People who have accessed these unconscious levels will have a great deal
of difficulty describing the essence of their experiences. It is
analogous to the difficulty of describing the essence of seeing a sunset
to someone who has been blind from birth. There is not only the
difficulty in describing an unfamiliar experience, but the problem of
differentiating one sunset from another. If one has seen only one
sunset, then it would be difficult to describe the essence of what a
sunset is. People who have seen many sunsets and think the world is flat
may describe the essence of their experience differently than people who
think the world is round. These problems are even simpler than the
problem of describing what happens when the unconscious is first
accessed.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-difficulty-of-describing-enlightenment">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.5. </span>The difficulty of describing enlightenment<a class="headerlink" href="#the-difficulty-of-describing-enlightenment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Each contemplative tradition has evolved one or more systems for
describing the sequence of experiences that people will have as they
access unconscious processes and penetrate to deeper and deeper levels.
Usually this information is restricted to teachers and scholars. Of
course, the scholars cannot understand what they are describing because
they lack direct personal experience, but they often think they
understand. This is one reason why scholars from different traditions
will argue endlessly.</p>
<p>Even when people have had the experience of accessing their unconscious
processes, there are many problems in relating their experiences to the
descriptions in the texts. There are problems of relating the
experiences to specific beliefs of the religion they belong to. There
are problems in relating experiences for which there are no words. There
are problems in describing experiences in such a way that does not
encourage other meditators to have too much in the way of expectation.
If meditators have too much expectation, they will have difficulty in
settling into a profound examination of the present moment. There are
problems in describing things in such a way that other meditators may
imagine they are having experiences they have not had. The textual
descriptions tend to describe experiences of one person as though
everyone has very much the same type of experiences. It is also said of
attempts to describe these experiences that, “Those who know need no
explanation.” “To those who do not know, no explanation is possible.”</p>
<p>Even for scholars in one tradition who have accessed their own
unconscious processes, there is difficulty in relating one system of
descriptions to another. For example, all Theravada Buddhist meditation
masters are familiar with Buddhaghosa’s Progress of Insight. Rarely, if
ever, are they aware that both the Mahamudra and the Buddha Families of
the Mahayana Buddhist tradition are descriptions of the same sequence of
experiences.</p>
</section>
<section id="mystical-experiences">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.6. </span>Mystical Experiences<a class="headerlink" href="#mystical-experiences" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Some people would insist that what I am referring to as <em>accessing
unconscious processes of the mind</em> is much more than a mundane
psychological insight. When I say this is a psychological insight, I do
not intend to limit it to being just psychological. When Saint Teresa of
Ávila said that an angel penetrated her heart with a spear and left her
slumped in ecstasy, this was a mystical as well as psychological
experience. An experience of this type could very well be an example of
the first time someone accessed his/her unconscious processes. It is
very common for the mind to spontaneously project all sorts of visionary
experiences the first time this happens. Typically, Buddhists have
visions in Buddhist metaphors, Christians have visions in Christian
metaphors, Native Americans have visions in Native American metaphors
and Scientists have visions in scientific metaphors.</p>
<p><em>Accessing the processes of the unconscious mind</em> means to observe the
process which are creating the reality of consciousness. People who have
accessed these processes may not be able to explain how reality is
created. They do have at least an intuitive understanding which serves
them very well. The understanding of reality is a central issue and a
common denominator for all religious traditions. Whether or not this is
a mystical experience is a question of semantics.</p>
<p>Most people who have accessed their unconscious processes would rate
their first access as one of the most profound experiences of their
lives. Even people who regard themselves as atheists report experiences
of transcending time and space. They might even say things like, “Space
and consciousness are the same thing. There is only one space and one
consciousness. The experience of self is only an illusion which
temporarily seems to create a separation from the one
space-consciousness. Ultimately, your greatest pleasure will be to let
go of your separation and merge your consciousness with the one
consciousness.” It is possible for people to make reports like this and
still regard themselves as atheists. Some people who report they have
had an experience of and understanding of the laws of karma regard this
as a profound mystical process. Others who have had essentially the same
experience regard it as becoming aware of a natural law such as the law
of gravity.</p>
</section>
<section id="moral-paragons">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.7. </span>Moral paragons<a class="headerlink" href="#moral-paragons" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Whether or not these profound experiences that people have are mystical
or psychological, the result is a new or deeper understanding of
morality. In Buddhism, the traditional commentary texts state that one
who has attained the first level of enlightenment is a moral paragon who
would not break five basic precepts. The precepts are: 1) Not to kill
any sentient being; 2) Speak only the truth and never lie; 3) Not to
steal or take anything which is not freely offered; 4) Not to engage in
sexual misconduct; 5) Not to take substances which dull the
consciousness. Of course, the Commentaries were written by monks who
follow very strict rules.</p>
<p>In the real world, it is questionable to say that an enlightened
layperson, especially a Westerner, would never kill a mosquito, or
absolutely keep any other precept. Habits and cultural differences are
deep conditionings which may create variations in the standards of the
Commentaries. However, it would be safe to say that those who are
enlightened would be naturally inclined to follow the precepts. They
would be moral paragons.</p>
<p>Among the factors which contribute to this increased sense of morality
is a greater clarity of mind and greater awareness of what is happening
in the present moment. Also, as deeper levels of the unconscious
processes are accessed, meditators will spontaneously experience this
sequence of mental states: unconditional loving-kindness, caring for the
suffering of others, sympathetic joy in the happiness of others and a
deep equanimity. These mental states will occur in this order and
meditation masters can recognize and judge the progress of their
students based on which state is manifesting. In addition to the
spontaneous manifestation, Buddhists have specific practices where these
four mental states are cultivated as a concentration meditation
practice. The carry over into daily life after intensive meditation
practice is variable and depends on personality and other factors, but
increased clarity, wisdom and compassion are hallmarks of the
enlightened mind.</p>

<section id="degrees-of-enlightenment">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.8. </span>Degrees of Enlightenment<a class="headerlink" href="#degrees-of-enlightenment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In the Buddhist view, people gradually become saints. One who has
attained the first level of enlightenment is regarded as being ¼ of a
saint or is partly enlightened; the second level is ½ of a saint and an
Arahant is a full saint. The Buddha frequently mentioned four levels of
enlightenment which he referred to as: Stream-winner, Once-returners,
Non-returners and Stream-crossers. The Buddha used many other names for
Stream-crosser. The most familiar is Arahant which means one worthy of
praise. He also called them Brahman which is the highest Hindu cast.
Buddhist scholars have evolved more technical terms which are more
commonly used by teachers today, which are: 1) <em>Sotapatti,</em> 2)
<em>Sakadagami,</em> 3) <em>Anagami,</em> 4) <em>Arahant.</em></p>
<p>The first level of enlightenment provides access to the grossest level
where consciousness is formed. The processes of cause and effect can be
perceived as the basis for an intuitive sense of morality. When this
level is first accessed in meditation, people frequently experience a
revolution in their perception of the nature of reality. Frequently they
say that they can now see that the reality they experience in the
present moment is the result of the effect they have intended to have on
other people. I am referring to a direct perception of processes and not
an intellectual or philosophical understanding. Sometimes people report
that they have contacted previous incarnations at this phase of
meditation, and they see the relationship of this in their current life.
Whether or not the reports of past lives are true contacts, or a way of
the mind illustrating a new understanding, the essential wisdom is the
same.</p>
<p>If you do actions with intentions of love, caring, sympathetic joy and
equanimity, this is the type of experience you will have from other
people. If you do actions with intentions of hate, disregard,
selfishness and craving, this is the type of experience you will have as
a result. This process is seen as a natural law—the law of karma. The
Buddhist view is that no entity enforces this law any more than an
entity enforces the law of gravity. The intuitive understanding that
comes from this insight is basically the same for each level but grows
broader and deeper with each level of enlightenment.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.9. </span>The stream of consciousness<a class="headerlink" href="#the-stream-of-consciousness" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Sigmund Freud attributed the discovery of both the unconscious mind and
the concept that consciousness was a stream, to the Buddha. The Buddha
frequently used the analogy of a stream in his discourses. He would
admonish people to use mindfulness to become like an island in the
stream of consciousness. We should not become swept away in the stream
by sense desires.</p>

<section id="stream-winner">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.10. </span>Stream-winner<a class="headerlink" href="#stream-winner" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Stream-winner is the first level of enlightenment. I have never been
satisfied by any of the descriptions of what changes occur as a result
of attaining it. I doubt that I ever will because it is sort of like
describing shifts in shades of grey. Also there is a wide variation in
changes from individual to individual as the result of attaining any
level of enlightenment. This makes clear definitive statements very
difficult.</p>
<p>The Buddha most often talked about the number of incarnations people
would have after attaining certain levels of enlightenment. A
stream-winner will not reincarnate in this world more than seven times.
A Once-returner will be born in this world only one more time. A
Non-returner will reincarnate only in a high heavenly realm. An Arahant
will go into Nirvana just before death and never return. This was a big
selling point in a Hindu dominated culture. People in the time of the
Buddha not only believed in reincarnation, but they were concerned about
having to endure an almost infinite number of lifetimes.</p>
<p>The number of incarnations before attaining enlightenment is not a hot
topic for most Westerners, but suffering is. Westerners want clearly
defined and quantified results or objectives. I could say that you would
have less suffering, but I cannot say precisely how you would suffer
less. I could say you would be happier, but I cannot say exactly how you
would be happier.</p>
<p>There are some definitive descriptions of changes at different levels of
enlightenment in the classic Commentaries by Buddhist scholars.
According to the Commentaries, with the attainment of each level certain
defilements of mind are uprooted, but more deeply rooted defilements
remain. At the first level, the defilements uprooted are: doubt that the
Eightfold Path will lead to total purification of the mind, belief that
rites and rituals will result in enlightenment, belief the self exists
and defilements which would cause rebirth in the realms of hell, hungry
ghosts and animals. The belief that only direct knowledge and perception
of one’s own mind can result in enlightenment becomes firmly
established, as well as an inclination to continue the process of
purification of one’s mind. At the second level, defilements of lust and
aversion are weakened. At the third level the defilements of lust and
aversion are fully uprooted. The Fourth is the highest path that can be
attained and still remain in a separate individual body. The final
defilements uprooted are: a. the last veil of unknowing, b.
restlessness, c. craving for the subtle material realms, d, craving for
the subtle immaterial realms, e. conceit.</p>
</section>
<section id="belief-in-self">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.11. </span>Belief in self<a class="headerlink" href="#belief-in-self" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The classic descriptions in the Commentaries don’t hold up very well to
Western standards of scientific quantifiable definition, for example,
the uprooting of the belief of self. I have yet to meet anyone who
believes that they do not exist as a result of becoming enlightened.
However, there is a change in the definition of self which occurs when
the first level of enlightenment is attained. Before enlightenment,
there is a tendency to define oneself as being in control of one’s
destiny, and after, one sees oneself as a natural process which must
follow natural laws. Before enlightenment, one tends to see oneself as a
solid fixed pattern, and after enlightenment, as a fluid pattern of
energy. These changes can be measured by psychological tests, but they
are projective tests which are regarded as <em>soft science</em> because they
involve subjective evaluations of the tester.</p>
<p>The Buddha had a negative attitude toward the Hindu belief in <em>atta</em>.
Westerners may believe in a soul, but it is a very fuzzy and poorly
defined concept compared to the Hindu concept. The Hindu concept is that
the core of your consciousness is an unchanging, unalterable object
which seems separated from the consciousness of God. The <em>atta</em> cannot
be affected by fire or cold, cut by a knife, smashed by a rock, shocked
by electricity, shot by a bullet, nor is it affected when you die.
Traditional Eastern Buddhist teachers spend a considerable amount of
time demolishing this concept of self that Westerners do not even have.
There is great value in this discussion in that it turns the attention
of the students to the processes of their consciousness.</p>
<p>I suspect that the Buddha had two reasons for his negative attitude
toward the concept of <em>‘atta’:</em> First is the unskillful beliefs
Hindu’s tend to have had about <em>atta;</em> Second is that <em>atta</em> types
of meditations should not be mixed with the <em>vipassana</em> type of
meditation the Buddha advocated. The Buddha was specifically against the
idea that the ritual breaking of the father’s skull on the funeral pyre
by the eldest son would release the <em>atta</em> and the father would attain
enlightenment, despite any sins. The Buddha likened this to expecting
rocks in a clay pot on the bottom of a pool of water, to float to the
surface if the pot were broken.</p>

<section id="wave-theory-vs-particle-theory">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.12. </span>Wave Theory vs Particle Theory<a class="headerlink" href="#wave-theory-vs-particle-theory" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Daniel Brown has pointed out that the theoretical model that the
Hindus use is analogous to the theoretical physicist’s wave theory. The
theoretical model Buddhists use is analogous to the particle theory. A
hundred years ago physicists were divided into camps of disagreement as
to whether matter and energy were particles or waves. Present day
physicists use both concepts and sometimes use the wave theory for
observations and sometimes use the particle theory. However, they follow
the Uncertainty Principle that says that waves and particles can never
be measured at the same time. This advice would serve meditators well,
in that they should never try to mix <em>atta</em> theories with Buddhist
practices that emphasize viewing objects as being particles.</p>
<p>I think it improves the Buddhist concept to understand the Hindu concept.
The analogy that I use comes from an experience that I had during my
two-year retreat in Hawaii. My retreat camp was located at the
three-thousand foot level on Mt. Haleakala, and I had a vast view of the
ocean at the base of the mountain. I was on the south side of the
island, so my view was of the edge of the wave crests moving by the
island. As a form of meditation, I would pick an approaching wave and
follow it as it passed my location and watch it as long as I could see
it in the distance. It was very clear that an individual wave had a
separate distinct existence, and at the same time, it never separated
from the ocean. The wave very clearly moved across the ocean, and I had
no question that it existed.</p>
<p>If I went down and got into the ocean and observed the water, I would
have a fundamentally different experience of the same phenomenon. Being
in the water I could directly experience that there was no wall of water
moving across the ocean. I would find myself drawn forward as a wave
approached and buoyed up by a wave and carried backwards by the wave and
I would fall and move forward again as the wave passed. It was very
clear that a wall of water was not moving across the ocean. It was
arising and falling in a circular motion. From this view, the wave does
not exist, and it is just an illusion that results from not seeing the
true nature of the water. Of course, the Buddhist view is to carefully
observe the water from a close perspective, and the Hindu view is to
carefully observe the water from a broad perspective.</p>
<p>In the Hindu macroscopic view, the origin of the wave of self cannot be
perceived, but it is understood that the origin is God. The destination
of the wave cannot be perceived, but it is understood that the
destination of the wave is God. At the same time, the wave seems to be a
separate individual entity, and paradoxically it is never separated from
the ocean which is God. The Hindu meditation practice develops an
awareness of the continuous wave of consciousness unfolding and
infolding into experiences. The Hindu practice focuses on the present
moment as does the Buddhist practice, but the perspective is different.</p>
<p>In the Buddhist microscopic view, the wave is disregarded and the focus
is on process of experience. Phenomena arise and pass away, but there is
no concern for where they come from or where they are going. Attempting
to establish a continuity of self or concern for the origin and
destination of phenomena would block the type of insight that Buddhist
practice is trying to develop. In successful Buddhist meditation
practice, objects become discontinuous and less real.</p>

<section id="deep-insight">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.13. </span>Deep insight<a class="headerlink" href="#deep-insight" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Just before meditators access the flow of unconscious processes, they
develop a very profound awareness of what Buddhists call <em>nama-rupa</em>,
or mind and matter. This is a state of awareness where the meditator
becomes vividly aware that there is the mind [nama] observing objects
[rupa]. This is fertile ground for what Buddhists refer to as <em>deep
insight.</em></p>
<p>The term <em>deep insight</em> is an abbreviation of <em>Deep Insight into
Arising and Passing of Phenomenon</em> described in the Commentaries. When
concentration and the ability to observe change are developed to the
point that thought processes can be observed to arise and pass in the
mind, the nature of objects of consciousness appears to change. After
deep insight, insight into faster and subtler components of the thought
process is realized, and the meditator acquires an intuitive wisdom
about the nature of consciousness and reality.</p>
<p>Enlightenment is the most important attainment in meditation practice,
but <em>deep insight</em> is almost as important. It is said that once <em>deep
insight</em> has been reached, it is certain that enlightenment will be
attained. However, describing <em>deep insight</em> is a very delicate issue
for two basic reasons. One is that there are three basically different
ways that <em>deep insight can</em> develop, and there are innumerable
variations of responses individuals have to this experience. The other
is that if the descriptions of what happens are too explicit, then other
meditators will mistake experiences they are having as being <em>deep
insight</em> experiences.</p>
<p>Assume for a moment that an objective description of <em>deep insight</em>
involved an intense itching of the left earlobe and a teacher
mentioned this at a retreat. It is fairly certain that meditators’
interviews the next day would include numerous reports of itching all
over the body, and some would report mild to intense itching of the left
earlobe. This would be confusing for the students and the teacher.
Teachers need to be very guarded in their descriptions of phenomena to
avoid spurious reports. Sometimes teachers use analogies for <em>deep
insight</em> rather than objective descriptions.</p>
<p>My favorite analogous description of <em>deep insight</em> and ensuing
developments comes from my teacher Sayadaw U Pandita. Suppose you are
walking toward a wall and you notice that there is a line on it. As you
look at the line, you notice that the line seems to be sort of moving.
You look at it closer and find that it is not only moving, but that it
is not even a solid line. It is actually composed of moving clumps. You
examine the clumps closely and discover that the clumps are composed of
even smaller clumps. You look at these clumps and find that these clumps
are actually composed of even smaller clumps. You come close to the wall
and find that the smaller clumps are made up of even smaller clumps. You
come right up to the wall and examine it very closely and discover that
the smallest clumps are actually groups of ants moving together.</p>
<p>The line of ants is a safe analogy for describing the changes in
perception of reality as one begins the process of entering the stream
of consciousness. <em>Nama-rupa</em> is when you become aware of the line on
the wall. <em>Deep insight</em> occurs when you discover your consciousness
is not a solid continuous event and you actually begin to see that
phenomena appear as discontinuous events that arise and pass away. This
is not an intellectual understanding that your consciousness is
changing, but a direct perception of the process. The phenomena you see
become fundamentally different. As concentration improves, you penetrate
the new phenomenon, and it again undergoes a fundamental change over and
over again until you see the ultimate reality of phenomena. After seeing
the briefest endurance of reality, the mindfulness shifts to Nirvana,
which is the ultimate reality. Nirvana is an experience of the
Unconditioned which defies any description. Any description of Nirvana
is not a description of Nirvana, and that is the most that can be said
about Nirvana. There are no reference points in Nirvana on which to base
a description.</p>
</section>
<section id="nirvana">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.14. </span>Nirvana<a class="headerlink" href="#nirvana" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A teacher determines that a student has experienced Nirvana partly on
the student’s inability to describe it. The student’s experience just
before and just after this experience will have certain distinctive
characteristics. Then a masterful teacher will give students specific
instructions to direct their practice in certain ways and evaluate their
proficiency in doing these tasks. After this, the teacher may directly
or indirectly let their students know they have attained the first level
of enlightenment.</p>
<p>The first experience of Nirvana is just a brief glimpse, but it is at
this point that one has truly entered the stream of consciousness. It is
like putting your foot on the bottom of the stream. During the course of
practice, the meditator experiences level after level of what were
unconscious strata of the mind. If practice is discontinued before the
experience of Nirvana and concentration is lost, then access to these
levels will be lost. It is as if the foot will eventually be returned to
the shore if the bottom of the stream is not touched. However, after the
first experience of Nirvana the first level of enlightenment is
attained. The first stratum of the former unconscious processes are then
permanently accessible to the consciousness.</p>

<section id="parinirvana">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.15. </span>Parinirvana<a class="headerlink" href="#parinirvana" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There is a final level of enlightenment the Buddha called parinirvana.
Once the final level of enlightenment is attained, Nirvana is never left
and individual existence ceases. Mahayana Buddhists take the Bodhisattva
Vow to delay their enlightenment until all sentient beings attain
enlightenment. The purpose is to remain in existence to be of help to
all other sentient beings in attaining enlightenment. Mahayana Buddhists
have different interpretations of what this vow means, but many regard
this as not entering <em>Parinirvana.</em></p>

<section id="finding-a-teacher">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.16. </span>Finding a teacher<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-a-teacher" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There are a number of factors to consider in determining who would be
the best teacher for you. Factors you might consider are: How
enlightened is the teacher? Do you have good chemistry with the teacher?
and is the teaching environment suitable? The more enlightened teachers
are, the deeper their intuitive understanding is. But the most
enlightened teacher may not be suitable for you, and it is not easy to
establish how enlightened a teacher is. Ultimately, you are looking for
a teacher that you think may be at least partly enlightened whose
teaching is in a context that you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Although a more enlightened teacher is generally a better teacher, it is
possible that a Western Stream-winner who thinks and speaks in your
language might be a better teacher for you than an Arahant who does not.
However, you would be well advised to make the effort to transcend the
difficulties of culture and translation, and take advantage of working
with an Arahant if you have the opportunity.</p>
<p>The Buddhists have a clear set of standards in terms of enlightenment
for teachers. It is always appropriate for anyone to share what they
know about meditation. If you have no level of attainment and know basic
meditation instructions you can share the instructions. But you should
never advise anyone beyond your level of attainment. If possible, even
giving basic instructions should be deferred to a qualified teacher.
According to the Buddha the minimum level for a qualified teacher is
having attained <em>deep insight.</em> Generally in Burma and Thailand the
second level of enlightenment is reached before someone is given
training and recognition for being a teacher because there are so many
who have attained this level. Of course, in the West, standards are much
lower because of the lack of teachers and comparatively few have
attained higher levels.</p>
<p>There is a major problem in finding a very enlightened teacher, or even
an enlightened teacher. As I will explain in greater detail in the
chapter on the Embarrassment of Enlightenment, attainment of
enlightenment is almost always a secret. Generally, you would be well
advised to avoid a teacher who claims to be enlightened or very
enlightened. However, there are ways of figuring out who is likely to be
enlightened and how enlightened they are if you use time, effort,
patience and a skillful approach. I will be saying more on that in the
chapter on <em>The Embarrassment of Enlightenment.</em></p>

<section id="practice-in-asia">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.17. </span>Practice in Asia<a class="headerlink" href="#practice-in-asia" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The degree of enlightenment alone should not be the only standard for
finding a suitable teacher. It is very possible to journey to Asia,
determine that someone is an Arahant, only to find out that he/she may
be an unsuitable teacher for you. The most likely obstacle is that
she/he may not speak English and no suitable translator is available.
You may have difficulties relating to the culture and personality of the
Arahant. Asian monasteries are notoriously noisy, hot and uncomfortable,
and there is a great chance you would be very ill some or all of the
time you are there. Some people thrive in these situations, but most
will find the difficulties too great.</p>
<p>There are some positive aspects to practicing in Thailand and Burma. It
is not necessary to ordain as a monk or a nun to practice in an Asian
monastery. My teacher, Sayadaw U Pandita discourages Westerners, in
Asia, from ordaining until after they have attained the first level of
enlightenment. The duties of monks and nuns take time from intensive
practice, plus dealing with awkward robes does not help the practice.
Foreign laypeople are usually very well cared for in Southeast Asian
monasteries, and in Burma there is no charge of any type, even for
laypeople, to stay in a monastery. Any monastery of a famous meditation
teacher in Thailand or Burma would be wealthy from strong public
support. If you are interested in a retreat longer than a month, the
plane ticket to Asia might be less than the cost of a retreat in the
West.</p>
<p>Even if you find an Arahant in a most suitable setting for you, there is
the question of what I call chemistry. Not everyone liked the Buddha. As
people become more enlightened, their personalties become more like
caricatures of their former personalities. (More on this in the next
chapter). Arahants typically have unusual and sometimes unpredictable
personalities. You are going to have good chemistry with some very
enlightened teachers, and with others you may not. You should consider
your limitations with dealing with certain types of situations and
personalities when looking for a suitable teacher.</p>
<p>Usually the best teaching situations involve a strong authoritarian
teacher who makes the rules and regulations. If there isn’t a strong
authoritarian teacher, then the staff and sometimes the meditators
become involved in spending enormous amounts of time and energy making
decisions.</p>
<p>In Asia it is not unusual for a monastery to become dysfunctional after
the death of a strong teacher. The reason is that the teaching of the
dharma tends to become an extension of the personality of the teacher.
Exceptionally good teachers teach intuitively and are likely to develop
a unique form or style of practice. Generally, they will want to avoid
situations where their teaching might clash with other strong teachers.
The use of different meditation objects, techniques, emphasis on study
etc. become a source of confusion for students. This is a good reason
why strong teachers usually prefer to have their own centers. In
Southeast Asia the monasteries are owned by a board of laymen and
occupied by monks. The board of directors will follow suggestions from
the founding teacher, but usually not from a successor.</p>
<p>Assuming that you are able to accept being in the authoritarian
environment of a strong teacher, there are other factors to consider.
Culture clash is not unusual. Some styles of practice involve many rites
and rituals that you may want to avoid. It is rare for Eastern teachers
to have scientific and logical views which are compatible with Western
culture. Western teachers are more likely to explain the dharma in
scientific terms or with personal stories, but generally they are not as
advanced in their personal practice as Eastern teachers. Eastern
teachers are more likely to be very traditional in their views and
methods of teaching.</p>
<p>Then there is the etiquette of relating to monks and nuns which is
uncomfortable to many Westerners. This repels some people and attracts
others. The bottom line is that you should feel that you have a good
chemistry with a teacher and the teaching situation, as one of your most
important standards.</p>

<section id="the-search">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.1.18. </span>The search<a class="headerlink" href="#the-search" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Your search for a teacher might include reading books, or listening to
tapes from many different teachers. When I was managing Insight
Recordings, my policy was to include free sample talks of a variety of
teachers with orders so people could make appropriate connections.
Although it is wise to do some shopping around for the right teacher, it
is even wiser to settle down with one teacher or style of practice when
you get into serious meditation practice.</p>
<p>There is a great danger in becoming superficially sophisticated. Some
people get into the habit of making the rounds of different teachers and
traditions. They become quite knowledgeable about personalities, gossip,
facilities, various techniques and practices, but never experience the
essence of the dharma. One teacher suggested that you should come to a
teacher like an empty glass of water. If you come like a full glass, you
will get little benefit.</p>

<p>The traditional belief in Asian countries is, that in the time of the
Buddha, it was easy to become enlightened. This is in line with both
Hindu and Buddhist scriptures, which describe the state of this world in
the past as being far superior to the present in both material and
spiritual standards. Many Buddhists believe that it is impossible to
attain enlightenment until the next Buddha comes. This is especially
true for Pureland Buddhists, who believe we must strive to be born in
the Pureland where enlightenment is possible. Even in Southeast Asia,
the majority of Buddhists make gifts to monks, attend rites and rituals
and even ordain as monks and nuns for the purpose of attaining merit to
be born in the time of the next Buddha.</p>

<section id="the-revival-of-enlightenment">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.2. </span>The revival of enlightenment<a class="headerlink" href="#the-revival-of-enlightenment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>About 100 years ago, a revolution in Buddhist practice began in
Southeast Asia. Some prominent monks in Thailand &amp; Burma discovered that
if people started with <em>vipassana</em> meditation, that it was possible to
become enlightened. For hundreds of years, it was believed that <em>samatha</em>
meditation must be mastered before a meditator should switch to
<em>vipassana.</em> In <em>samatha</em> meditation the emphasis is focusing the
mind on an object in a steady manner. In <em>vipassana</em> meditation the
object is investigated to observe its true nature and change. <em>Samatha</em>
is essential for <em>vipassana,</em> but the new discovery was that
<em>samatha</em> can be developed simultaneously with <em>vipassana</em>. <em>Samatha</em> is
focusing the mind on an object, and <em>vipassana</em> is a way of looking
at the object. It really doesn’t matter what meditation object is used
in <em>vipassana.</em> Ultimately, the object becomes a screen for observing
the processes of the mind.</p>
<p>Although <em>samatha</em> meditation can result in developing great power and
bliss, these effects wear off quickly after meditation. Successful
<em>samatha</em> meditators frequently develop almost an addictive attachment
to their meditation practice becoming dependent on meditation for their
happiness, and they become irritable if their meditation is interrupted.
Without proper instruction, a <em>samatha</em> meditator is likely to develop
a fixed focus on an object that precludes observing the changes which
are essential for <em>vipassana.</em></p>
<p>Until about 100 years ago, the meditation practice done in Theravada
monasteries was almost exclusively <em>samatha.</em> When <em>vipassana</em>
meditation monasteries were first built, there was considerable
criticism from conservative monks. This controversy continues to this
day as some prominent Buddhist monks still cling to the idea that
enlightenment is unlikely until the next Buddha comes. However, the
enthusiasm of many thousands of people who have attained some level of
enlightenment has resulted in a dynamic growth of the meditation
monasteries in Thailand, Burma and Sri Lanka. This trend is spreading to
all parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
</section>
<section id="mainstream-entry">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.3. </span>Mainstream-entry<a class="headerlink" href="#mainstream-entry" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Although emigrants from Asia have brought Buddhism with them, it has had
little tendency to enter the main stream of Western culture. However,
the practice traditions which result in enlightenment are now slowly
entering Western culture. The strongest influence is from Tibetan
Buddhism and the Zen traditions through Japan and Korea, and the least
prominent is <em>vipassana</em> practice from Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The success of different traditions in transplanting to the West seems
to depend on contact with impressive meditation masters more than the
tradition’s intrinsic compatibility with Western culture. Tibetan
Buddhism with its nondemocratic lineages, rites, rituals, magic and
innumerable deities to worship, would seem the least compatible with
Western culture. The significant success of Tibetan Buddhism is due to
the very impressive high lamas who were forced out of Tibet in the
Exodus.</p>
<p>Likewise, the occupation of Japan after World War II and troops
stationed in Korea brought American troops into contact with some very
impressive Zen masters. The method of Zen emphasizes exacerbating
confusion and discourages clear analytical thinking. There is a very
strong characteristic in Western scientific thinking to analyze,
quantify and qualify which is in direct opposition to Zen. Japanese Zen,
in particular, has a strong Samurai militaristic characteristic which
gives their practice a boot camp type character. Americans regard boot
camp as a necessary hardship, but the true American ideal is to
celebrate individualism.</p>
<p>It would seem that Theravada Buddhism with its emphasis on scholarship,
logic and systematic analysis would be more compatible with Western
culture. Also, the practice of the simple technique of <em>vipassana</em>
meditation, almost devoid of rites, rituals and mystical mumbo jumbo
is intrinsically much more appealing to Westerners. It seems that the
limited success of Theravadans in the West is a result of the limited
contact Westerners have had with advanced meditation practitioners. Even
in Southeast Asia, <em>vipassana</em> meditation monasteries are still only a
rapidly growing minority. The contacts which have brought this tradition
to the West have primarily been a small group of Peace Corps workers and
hippies on spiritual quests in the 1960’s and 1970’s.</p>
<p>The introduction of Buddhism into Western culture is a very significant
event. Arnold Toynbee is regarded as one of the greatest historians of
modern times. Back in the 1930’s, he wrote the following, “When
historians look back at the 20th century, they won’t have much interest
in things like communism or capitalism: those will be ripples in the
great historical picture. What will really be significant is the impact
of Buddhism as it enters the West, because Buddhism has transformed
every culture as it has entered, and Buddhism has been transformed by
its entry into that culture.”</p>

<section id="buddhism-encounters-buddhism">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.4. </span>Buddhism encounters Buddhism<a class="headerlink" href="#buddhism-encounters-buddhism" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Buddhism is not only encountering another culture in the West, but
unique in history, Buddhism is encountering Buddhism. Historically,
Buddhism has been very provincial in its view. Each village in Asia
considers the teachings in its area to be the one true teaching of the
Buddha’s <em>dharma.</em> They see all others as more or less in error. The
Burmese think they have a better and purer Buddhism than Thailand. Thais
and Burmese look down on Sri Lankans as having a degenerated Buddhism.
However, all the Southeast Asians agree that the Mahayana Buddhists are
way off track. When Buddhists were isolated, it did not matter because
they were talking to themselves. With modern communication and
transportation, they are missing out on the potential of sharing the
special benefits that each tradition has to offer, because of their
provincial attitudes.</p>
<p>Buddhist leaders who have come to the West have shown a remarkable
tendency to maintain their provincial views. However, the Western
students have been much more open to exploring different forms of
Buddhism. Buddhism has become so integrated with Asian cultures that it
has become almost impossible for Asians to distinguish between the
essence of Buddhism and their culture. Westerners exploring different
forms of Buddhism are much more able to spot the common denominators and
see the essence of the Buddha’s teaching.</p>
<p>This is not entirely an intellectual process. What the Buddha did was to
describe natural laws that he came to understand from exploring his own
consciousness. He developed a philosophy and psychology which had the
ultimate purpose of attaining enlightenment. As Buddhism integrates with
and transforms a culture, the transformed elements of the culture become
part of Buddhism. By doing the practice successfully, anyone can have
the experiences which were the basis for the Buddha’s natural laws and
psychology. Having this experience plus studying different Buddhist
traditions makes it possible to identify the essence of the Buddha’s
teachings within different cultures.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-way-buddha-taught">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.5. </span>The way Buddha taught<a class="headerlink" href="#the-way-buddha-taught" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The way Buddha taught exceeded what could be written down. It seems
reasonable that the Buddha taught in a similar way that meditation
masters do today. As meditation masters talk about Buddhist philosophy
and psychology, they will intuitively access the levels of their
consciousness where they came to understand the things they talk about.
They will spontaneously resonate on a psychic level to the unconscious
of their listeners. This resonance will make their students’ unconscious
processes more accessible to them, and some of them will begin to access
the unconscious stream of their consciousness. This access might be made
during a discourse, or later during meditation. Once this process is
started in people, they simply need to meditate until they attain
enlightenment. It is much like tending a fire until all the wood in a
pile is consumed. To do this properly, they should separate themselves
from their normal daily life, and practice in a protected
environment where proper guidance is available until this process is
completed.</p>
<p>The actual techniques early Buddhist teachers taught were various ways
of focusing attention, and unique instructions were given to balance
characteristics they saw in their students. It really does not matter
what technique is used, as long as it results in a profound examination
of the present moment. Those who believe that the Buddha had one true
technique have missed this essential point.</p>
</section>
<section id="formless-practice">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.6. </span>Formless practice<a class="headerlink" href="#formless-practice" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Most Buddhist meditation teachers today are taught to apply a
standardized technique to their students. This is not necessarily bad as
an enlightened teacher will intuitively modify the instructions to their
students needs, and the standardized technique provides some structure
of uniformity that reduces confusion, at least within the tradition.
However, trying to intellectually understand details of the instruction
frequently leads to problems in the practice. Some people are more
adversely affected by this than others. I suspect that the recent
popularity of Dzogchen, non-dual and formless practice from both the
Hindu and Tibetan traditions is in part an indication of reaction to
overemphasis on <em>exact technique.</em> Formless practice which, involves
dialogue with a charismatic teacher and self inquiry, has decimated some
<em>vipassana</em> groups around the country. Some people who practiced
<em>vipassana</em> unsuccessfully for years have been successful with this
method.</p>
<p>In Dzogchen and other formless practices, enlightenment is attained by
dialogue with the teacher and listening to the teacher having dialogues
with other students in the group. Unfortunately, some of these teachers
tend to cultivate a negative attitude in their students toward any
particular method or tradition. Followers of formless practice tend to
be dependent on the presence of their teacher to progress, but they
waste less concentration on trying to understand theory or subtle points
about technique.</p>
<p>The essential point that I want to make is that any one technique that
is used is not critically important The way the consciousness is
directed is important, whether a technique is used or not used. Any
method or non-method which results in a profound examination of the
present moment can, under the guidance of an enlightened teacher, result
in enlightenment.</p>

<p>In the <em>Mahasatipatthana Sutta,</em> the Buddha advises people to go sit
“at the root of a tree” or in a “chamber”. Early Buddhist monasteries
were very simple compared with present day monasteries. Records of the
Buddha’s discourses indicate that the first monasteries were meditation
camps with a scattering of very small huts (made of branches, leaves and
grass) sometimes caves, and an assembly area which was usually outdoors.
In later sutras, the meeting area was sometimes described as a large
room with a sand floor. Monks and nuns would assemble when a bell was
rung. There would be no kitchen as the custom was to take a begging bowl
to a nearby village, or in some cases laypeople would bring food to
them. It wasn’t until about two hundred years after the time of the
Buddha that Buddha statues, elaborate temples, rites and rituals became
common.</p>

<section id="the-oral-tradition">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.8. </span>The oral tradition<a class="headerlink" href="#the-oral-tradition" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Early Buddhism involved no reading or writing. As was the tradition for
other religions of India at that time, spiritual teachings were given
orally, even though devotees knew how to write. One form of teaching
involved chanting stylized summaries of the Buddha’s discourses. This
occupied the monks and nuns, developed concentration and provided a
vehicle for the teacher’s transmission of the <em>dharma.</em> Monks and nuns
would also have to learn to recite the list of rules of behavior that
the Buddha prescribed. The rules are methods for maintaining restraint
but, they also have the purpose of cultivating continuous mindfulness.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.9. </span>The wide variety of methods<a class="headerlink" href="#the-wide-variety-of-methods" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The records of discourses briefly mention the Buddha giving people a
wide variety of methods of meditation, and except for the
<em>Mahasatipatthana Sutta,</em> there is little description of technique. It
is possible that the Buddha expected teachers to rely on their intuitive
powers in developing a teaching style of their own, and modifying
methods to unique needs of individuals. This is what most of the best
meditation teachers do today. There is no conclusive proof that early
Buddhists followed any of the elaborately prescribed rigid forms of
practice typical of modern traditions. Some Buddhists insist that they
are following the only true method taught by the Buddha, and others will
explain that the degenerated times require regimented forms of practice.</p>
<p>The Buddha seems to have had an extraordinary psychic power to ignite
the process of insight in people. Even allowing for exaggeration and
glorification which comes with the development of all religions, he must
have been an extraordinary teacher. There are many reports, in the
discourses, about people attaining the first level of enlightenment, and
sometimes multiple levels of enlightenment while listening to the
Buddha.</p>

<p>The attainment of enlightenment is very dependent upon the quality of
teaching and teachers. For example, in 1984 Sayadaw U Pandita led a
three-month retreat for teachers at IMS in Barre, Massachusetts. During
that retreat, some teachers attained the second level of enlightenment
or insight to that level. Since that retreat, the number of people
attaining <em>deep insight</em> during regular retreats has doubled. Also, it
was unknown for people to attain higher levels of enlightenment at IMS
before then, and since then a few have attained the third level.</p>

and there were many men and women who attained the level of Arahant who
were also extraordinary teachers. The Buddha taught in an area of India
which was relatively peaceful because it was dominated by the kingdom of
Magadha. Meditation and spiritual practices were very highly respected
in Hindu culture, and there was a strong tradition of public support for
holy men. There is fertile ground for enlightenment during times when
there is extra food to support meditators, times of peace when young men
are not conscripted, and there is broad public support for spiritual
practice. When these conditions are combined with the high quality
teaching of the Buddha, there are going to be more people getting
enlightened. It is just as logical that at times of war, plagues and
famine there are going to be fewer people enlightened.</p>
<p>The Buddhists of Southeast Asia have a stylized view of the general
spiritual decline since the time of the Buddha. Their view is that the
operant factor is the length of time since the passing of the last
Buddha. This view does not include the effect of cycles of war, plague
and famine on the practice of meditation, although they are regarded as
signs of decline. On the other hand, the Tibetan Buddhists regard their
teaching of Buddhism as better and more advanced than earlier forms of
Buddhism. Tibet was relatively peaceful and was able to produce an
abundance of food over hundreds of years before the Chinese invasion.
Tibet was uniquely successful as a Buddhist country, largely because of
its comparative isolation from foreign influence and domination. Before
the Chinese invasion, the population of Tibet had fallen from
six-million to two-million, over several hundred years primarily because
so many people ordained as monks and nuns. Southeast Asia still is not
up to that level of success.</p>
<p>Historically, Buddhism has been eradicated from many countries because
of war and politics, including the land of its origin, India. Even in
the 20th century, Buddhism has almost disappeared from several countries
for this reason. For the first two-hundred years, Buddhism was purely an
oral tradition. It was not until King Asoka sponsored writing down of
all of the Buddha’s discourses that were known two hundred years after
the time of the Buddha that Buddhism became focused on written texts.
The Abhidhamma (Buddhist psychology) wasn’t written down for
five-hundred years after the death of the Buddha. Modern communication,
transportation and media have made the prospect for the reestablishment
of Buddhism after calamities comparatively quick and easy. In ancient
times there must have been a greater gap, and much of the vitality of
early Buddhism was lost.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.12. </span>Transmission of the dharma<a class="headerlink" href="#transmission-of-the-dharma" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There are approximately one-hundred-thousand pages of the Buddha’s
discourses, and yet they contain almost no specific instruction on how
to meditate. The <em>Mahasatipatthana Sutta</em> is the richest source of
information on meditation practice. However, it is unlikely that someone
could use these instructions alone to meditate correctly. It is the
nature of enlightenment that many important teachings cannot be given
until a student’s practice has progressed to specific levels, and this
may be one reason written instructions may be inadequate. Monks in Sri
Lanka had these instructions for hundreds of years after calamities and
could not attain enlightenment with them. It is quite possible that the
Buddha intended that instructions could only be obtained orally, direct
from a teacher.</p>
<p>Without the personal guidance of an enlightened teacher, it is very
unlikely that the average person could successfully follow even the most
explicit instructions. Some authors of books on meditation have reported
that occasionally readers were able to practice successfully without
personal guidance. These cases are rare.</p>
<p>It seems that when a Buddhist culture goes through a time of disaster,
it is usually unable to support unproductive monastics. Even if the gap
is long enough so that there are no enlightened teachers, the culture
will retain its Buddhist religion. Temples and monasteries will be
rebuilt and scholars will copy texts and write Commentaries. However,
the vitality of transmission from enlightened teachers may be lost.
Mistakes in understanding the written text can be made, such as the
incorrect use of <em>samatha</em> practice in Southeast Asia. Although
Buddhism may appear to be revived, it may be only an empty religion of
moral code, rites, rituals and no enlightenment.</p>
<p>The point I want to make is that it is not necessarily true that
enlightenment is intrinsically more difficult today than at the time of
the Buddha. I think that if people are motivated to practice, have the
proper environment in which to practice and have proper guidance in the
right technique with an enlightened teacher, then they have the basic
ingredients for success. Of course, better teachers will get better
results.</p>
</section>
<section id="follow-instructions-exactly">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.13. </span>Follow instructions exactly<a class="headerlink" href="#follow-instructions-exactly" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The majority of the people who make little progress in their practice
are not following meditation instructions as given. Only a meditation
master should mix techniques from different traditions. You should avoid
making any modification in the instructions without discussing it with
your teacher. One of my friends, who had done many years of intensive
<em>vipassana</em> meditation, never mentioned to her teachers that she was
also doing a mantra along with the regular practice. As soon as she
stopped doing the mantra she began to make progress. A slight
modification to the instructions that makes the practice more pleasant
or easier is very likely to sabotage it.</p>
<p>The most common variation on meditation instructions is to
deliberately indulge in psychotherapy. After the mind becomes calm and a
little concentrated from following the instructions, all sorts of
psychological insights may occur. Memories from childhood may start
bubbling up, or you might start to understand addictive behavior, or
work out problems with relationships. This process can become like
pulling feathers out of a down pillow. One insight leads to another and
it just goes on and on indefinitely. Although there might be
psychological benefit from this, it is a poor trade for the benefits of
true meditation practice. Many people have chosen psychotherapy over
enlightenment. Someone asked Anagarika Munindra, a great Buddhist
meditation master in India, why it was easier for Asians to attain
enlightenment. His reply was that, “Westerners are doing psychotherapy.”</p>
<p>Another variation on meditation instruction is to indulge in daydreams.
After the mind becomes calm and concentrated from doing a little
practice, images in the mind may become clear and colorful. It is
pleasant for the mind to wander into pleasurable daydreams. Daydreams
occur naturally from time to time in the practice, but they should not
be cultivated.</p>
<p><em>Vipassana</em> meditation makes the mind very creative. You are very
likely to get all sorts of insights, ideas for talks or books,
inventions, artistic designs or community projects, and it will be very
tempting to stop the practice and develop them. During a two month
period of my practice, I deliberately spent one-third of my sittings
doing some mathematical calculations and developing theoretical models
in my head. I thought that I was only losing one-third of my practice
time. Later I came to understand how much momentum of progress I was
losing in my practice. Typically, meditators cover the area of progress
that I was making in my practice at that time in only a few hours.
Instead of losing one-third of my progress in practice, I had lost
almost all of what I could have accomplished in two months.</p>

<section id="how-long-to-enlightenment">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.14. </span>How Long to Enlightenment?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-long-to-enlightenment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>I haven’t seen any good statistics on how long it takes to become
enlightened. In any event, there are many variables to consider such as
how enlightened and suitable your teacher is, the proper environment,
the state of your practice, understanding and following the
instructions, just to mention a few. The Buddha said that if people
practiced continuously it would take between seven years and seven days
to become an Arahant. Those figures seem reasonable if your teacher is
the Buddha. One of my teachers, Tungpulu Sayadaw, practiced in a cave
for thirty-nine years without lying down, and he emerged an Arahant.
Another of my teachers, Dipa Ma, did three consecutive three-month
retreats, and attained a new level of enlightenment during each. If you
have a strong, correct daily practice, then a reasonable expectation
could be to attain <em>deep insight</em> in a ten-day retreat. If you have
attained <em>deep insight</em> in a ten-day retreat, then you have excellent
chances of attaining enlightenment on a three-month retreat.</p>
<p>Once <em>deep insight</em> is attained, the time it takes to reach the first
level of enlightenment depends on being able to observe precisely what
is happening without trying to manipulate what is happening. For
example, at certain phases of the practice people are likely to
experience visions. Some develop an attachment to these visions and even
learn how to produce them, It is possible to dwell in this phase of the
practice for prolonged periods, but the normal course of these visions
should be only a few hours. A similar attachment can develop to pleasant
energy sensations that flow through the body. Not all temptations to
manipulate what is happening are based on pleasant feelings. Sometimes
there are unusual pains, or feelings that the body is rotting. These
phenomena should be observed precisely, without trying to make them go
away. How long it will take to be able to profoundly examine pleasant
and unpleasant phenomena with equanimity is a key factor in determining
how long it will take for enlightenment to be attained.</p>
<p>Again, I haven’t seen any good statistics on how long it takes to get
from <em>deep insight</em> to Stream-winning. One teacher said it takes an
average of seven weeks for the average person. I have heard of people
doing it in two weeks, and one friend was not able to finish after 10
years of doing at least one three-month retreat every year. My sense of
it is that the seven week figure is probably fairly close to the
average.</p>
<p>It is an interesting phenomenon that the higher the level of
enlightenment, the more rapidly people progress from <em>deep insight</em>
to enlightenment. The key to the higher levels of enlightenment is
attaining <em>deep insight</em> to the higher path. After the first level has
been attained, most of the time spent doing intensive practice is
preparation for being able to attain <em>deep insight</em> again. One study
of how long it took to finish the second path after <em>deep insight</em>
ranges between two weeks and ten hours. One of my teachers went from
the third level of enlightenment to attainment of the fourth in one
sitting. The experience of each path is essentially the same, except
that the final phase of equanimity gets much deeper in each path. The
reason that the higher paths go so rapidly seems to be that after the
first experience, meditators intuitively know not to manipulate their
experiences.</p>

<p>Frequently people have misconceptions about the possibility of
enlightenment. Some believe that enlightenment depends on grace from God
or a guru. Other misconceptions involve the importance of past lives,
vegetarianism, sex, race, education, and intelligence.</p>
</section>
<section id="grace">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.16. </span>Grace<a class="headerlink" href="#grace" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The Snowmass Contemplative Group attempted to see if all traditions
would agree that there is such a thing as <em>grace.</em> All but the
Buddhists agreed that there was grace. Although many Mahayana Buddhists
pray to various deities to intercede and help them, the view of the
Buddha was that our fate is determined by the natural law of karma. From
the particle theory type view of the Buddhists, there would be no
exceptions to the law of karma any more than there would be an exception
to the law of gravity. What we experience is the result of our
volitional intent towards other sentient beings. The Buddha challenged
the idea that we could change our karma with rites, rituals and prayers.
He explicitly spoke against the idea that enlightenment could be
attained this way. Although teachers or gurus can help as guides, each
of us has to take the journey ourselves. This is in line with the
conclusions of the Snowmass Contemplative Group.</p>
</section>
<section id="past-lives">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.17. </span>Past lives<a class="headerlink" href="#past-lives" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Another unprofitable view is that the spiritual work and merit from our
past lives will determine whether or not we attain enlightenment.
Whatever we have done in our past lives cannot be changed. In any event,
the basic factor in attaining enlightenment is settling into a profound
examination of the present moment. Concern for past lives can prevent
this from happening.</p>
</section>
<section id="avoid-getting-too-complicated-in-moral-reasoning">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.18. </span>Avoid getting too complicated in moral reasoning<a class="headerlink" href="#avoid-getting-too-complicated-in-moral-reasoning" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Concern for the five basic precepts of not telling lies, not harming,
not stealing, avoiding sexual misconduct and avoiding intoxicants is
helpful. Basic morality is a necessary prerequisite for a calm
concentrated mind. However, we should avoid getting too complicated in
our moral reasoning. Buddhist morality is a very simple situation of how
your actions directly affect other sentient beings. A hamburger is not a
sentient being. The Buddhist vow for monks and nuns is very explicit in
saying that they may not eat meat if they asked for the animal to be
killed, or if they knew the animal was specifically killed for them. A
common erroneous belief is that Buddhists are vegetarians. This simply
is not true for all Buddhists.</p>
</section>
<section id="diet">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.19. </span>Diet<a class="headerlink" href="#diet" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Some Mahayana traditions do have a custom of eating only vegetarian food
on retreats, but this is not true for Theravada traditions. Curiously,
it has become a tradition for Theravada retreats in the West to be
vegetarian. One theory is that Goenka, a vegetarian and former Hindu,
set the pattern for non-monastic lay retreats in the West. The first
well known Theravada lay teachers in the West had attended Goenka
retreats in India. They patterned their retreats after Goenka retreats.
Another curiosity is that most of the key people responsible for
establishing the vegetarian tradition at <em>vipassana</em> retreats are not
vegetarians.</p>
<p>When Sayadaw U Pandita first came to the West in 1984, he was quite
concerned about the vegetarian diet served at the Insight Meditation
Society. He conceded that concern for the welfare of animals was
commendable, and that eating meat was unhealthy, as well as ecologically
questionable. However, he was very strongly against his students
becoming vegetarians for the first time when they go on retreat. He
observed that it takes time for the body to become adapted to a
vegetarian diet, and an initial effect would be a loss of energy. High
energy is a key factor of enlightenment and is very important in his
style of practice. He was so concerned about this that he arranged for
some of his students, who were having problems with the IMS diet, to be
served meat prepared by volunteer cooks outside the IMS kitchen.
Vegetarianism is so firmly entrenched at IMS that despite U Pandita’s
public suggestions the Board of Directors never even considered changing
the diet.</p>
</section>
<section id="celibacy">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.20. </span>Celibacy<a class="headerlink" href="#celibacy" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Another misconception, that probably comes from the Hindu tradition, is
that celibacy is essential for enlightenment. Celibacy is required for
monks and nuns primarily to simplify their lives and focus on their
practice. Also, during intensive meditation retreats, celibacy is
required for laypeople for the same reason. However, Buddhists in daily
life situations are not required to be celibate. Buddhists are required
to avoid sexual misconduct, but it is not clear what this means in
California. Many Buddhist teachers suggest that people should not engage
in sexual activities which result in anyone suffering. This is a vague
standard that could be logically argued to be a total prohibition of
sex, or an invitation to free love. Perhaps it is sufficient to simply
practice continuous mindfulness in situations where the issue of sex
arises.</p>
<p>The purpose of Buddhist precepts is pragmatic in that they are directed
at achieving a quiet mind. If your sex life is causing mental agitation
in your meditations, you should change your behavior. While on retreat,
you should avoid letting your senses wander to sexually stimulating
objects and direct to your attention to meditation objects. In the daily
life situation this may result in becoming a horny, neurotic celibate
which may not be good for your practice. It is better to be simple and
direct in your views, instead of getting involved in elaborate logical
reasoning about right and wrong.</p>

<section id="asians-and-enlightenment">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.21. </span>Asians and enlightenment<a class="headerlink" href="#asians-and-enlightenment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>You would also be well advised to ignore rumors that enlightenment is
easy for Asians and difficult or impossible for Westerners. I have not
seen any good statistics on this, but it is generally conceded that
Asians are more likely to be successful in their practice. There is a
definite advantage in being raised in a Buddhist culture simply because
faith is a very positive contribution to the practice. Also a positive,
receptive attitude for taking instructions from monks has a beneficial
effect on the practice.</p>
<p>Despite these advantages some Westerners get enlightened quickly, and
some Asians take a long time. Your situation is your situation, and
there is no benefit in comparing yourself to anyone else. All you need
to do is to follow the instructions diligently and cultivate a profound
examination of the present moment.</p>
</section>
<section id="sitting-on-the-floor">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.22. </span>Sitting on the floor<a class="headerlink" href="#sitting-on-the-floor" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Asians who have adapted their muscles and bones to sitting on the floor
can sit erect and cross-legged much more comfortably than Westerners.
There is some advantage in maintaining a better energy level in
meditation by sitting cross legged on the floor. You would be well
advised to try this out and progressively develop a greater ability to
do this. However, most Western teachers do not believe it is worth going
through a great deal of pain and suffering stretching out your body just
to do this. There are many people who have attained enlightenment who
could only sit in chairs. However, most teachers advise against resting
the back against the chair or attempting the lying meditation until your
practice becomes quite advanced.</p>
<p>There are many Asian teachers who are unaware how difficult it is for
Westerners to adapt their bodies. They can be very insistent that you
sit on the floor. Just do not worry too much about this. If you can’t
sit reasonably comfortably on the floor, practice in Asia may not be for
you.</p>
<p>One time Ram Dass went to Burma with the intention of doing a
three-month <em>vipassana</em> retreat. He was determined to follow his
teacher’s instruction to sit on the floor, and although a cushion would
have been permissible, he did not feel that sitting on one would have
been appropriate for his image. After about a month, he was on the verge
of reattaining the experience of <em>deep insight</em> that he had reached on
psychedelics. His back had gone out, and he was experiencing great pain.
Pain in this phase of the practice is usually exaggerated. He continued
to sit on the floor without a cushion enduring great pain. Then a
message came that his stepmother was ill, and he took this excuse to
escape the retreat. His teacher told him to continue his retreat, as he
was on the verge of a major breakthrough in his practice. The pain he
was experiencing was so great that he declined his teacher’s advice.
Since then, he has never had the courage to again undertake such a
rigorous commitment.</p>

<section id="intelligence-and-enlightenment">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.23. </span>Intelligence and enlightenment<a class="headerlink" href="#intelligence-and-enlightenment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Other things you need not worry about are lacking intelligence and
education. One of Dr. Jack Engler’s research subjects was a moron.
Although it took this lady a very long time to retain the meditation
instructions, once she understood them she very quickly became
enlightened. She was still a moron, but at least she was an enlightened
moron.</p>
<p>There is one negative aspect to being intelligent or highly educated.
The problem is that discursive and analytical thinking has a very
negative effect on being able to develop a calm and concentrated mind.
Intelligent and educated people are very prone to thinking about things.
The essence of <em>vipassana</em> meditation is to develop a profound
examination of objects of consciousness. Thinking is not observation.
The more advanced your practice becomes, the less logical or reasonable
your objects of perception become. It is essential to develop the
ability to profoundly examine and penetrate into objects of meditation
without thinking about them. Intellectuals, as a group, progress in
meditation more slowly and are less likely to be successful. However, I
know several people who have a Ph D, MD or other highly educated status
and have become enlightened.</p>
<p>Intelligence and education can have some advantages for a meditator such
as understanding the potential of meditation and cultivating
philosophical understanding, but you must develop the ability to suspend
intellectual processes during the practice. The Buddha always invited
people to come and see for themselves and challenge the things he said.
Buddhism places a very strong emphasis on developing a very logical
philosophy to support the practice.</p>
<p>Arthur C. Clarke is a scientifically oriented science fiction writer,
and he has had significant success in predicting future trends. He has
said that Buddhism will be the only one of the worlds major religions
which will survive in the distant future. The reason is that the basic
authority for other religions is faith. The basic authority for Buddhism
is a logical process that can be verified by anyone who takes the time
to investigate it.</p>

<section id="id1">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.2.24. </span>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The traditional belief is that the longer the time it has been since the
time of the Buddha, the more difficult it is to attain enlightenment.
However, the recent revival of practice in Southeast Asia indicates that
the operant factors are qualified, enlightened teachers, a safe secluded
environment to practice and following instructions exactly. Being overly
obsessed with precise methods, grace, past lives, complicated morality,
sitting on the floor, or intellectual activities can be very detrimental
to success in the practice of meditation. Times of peace, prosperity and
availability of the teachings of the dharma are historically rare, and
anyone would be wise to take full advantage of this opportunity.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">4.3. </span>The Embarrassment of Enlightenment<a class="headerlink" href="#the-embarrassment-of-enlightenment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Enlightenment has always been an embarrassing subject for Buddhism.
Enlightenment is embarrassing because it is the most important status in
Buddhism, and it is difficult to determine if someone is enlightened. At
one time or another, almost everyone in Buddhism will be embarrassed
about enlightenment. Some are embarrassed because they are not
enlightened, some because they are enlightened, and others are
embarrassed because they do not know whether or not they are
enlightened. A few reasons why people become embarrassed about
enlightenment are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>They think they cannot become enlightened.</p></li>
<li><p>They assume that the enlightened will conform to their arbitrary
models.</p></li>
<li><p>They assume that the enlightened will seem reasonable and rational.</p></li>
<li><p>They assume that the enlightened will conform to standards of the
Theravada Commentaries.</p></li>
<li><p>They want to be enlightened and are not.</p></li>
<li><p>They think they are enlightened and are not.</p></li>
<li><p>They do not know whether or not they are enlightened.</p></li>
<li><p>They are enlightened, but do not want to say that they are
enlightened.</p></li>
<li><p>They are partly enlightened, but not fully enlightened.</p></li>
<li><p>They think certain people must be or cannot be enlightened because of
the amount of time they have meditated.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="they-think-they-cannot-become-enlightened">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.1. </span>They think they cannot become enlightened.<a class="headerlink" href="#they-think-they-cannot-become-enlightened" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>After becoming aware of the possibility of enlightenment, most people
will go through a period of thinking that they cannot become
enlightened. Some may have only brief moments of doubt, but others
unfortunately, may become obsessed with it. I think it is helpful to
make a realistic appraisal about the possibility of enlightenment.</p>
<p>The Buddha said that there are four basic types concerning the amount of
time and effort it takes to become enlightened. Some will find it easy
and will quickly become enlightened. Some will find the practice easy,
but it will take them a long time to become enlightened. Some will find
the practice very difficult, but they become enlightened quickly. Some
will find the practice difficult and it will take them a long time. The
Buddha also mentioned that there are some people who could practice all
their lives and have the Buddha for a teacher, but will not become
enlightened. Fortunately this latter group is very small.</p>
<p>People raised in a Buddhist culture take great comfort in many
assurances that even if they do not attain enlightenment in this
lifetime, there are things they can do to assure enlightenment in future
incarnations. Ordaining as a monk or a nun, even for a brief period, is
said to assure attainment of enlightenment. Supporting monasteries,
monks and nuns results in merit which brings enlightenment. Virtuous
actions such as keeping the five precepts, supporting parents and
meditation contribute to attainment of enlightenment. Many Buddhists have
no expectation of attaining enlightenment in this lifetime, but
diligently do things that contribute to future enlightenment.</p>
<p>It is doubtful that expectation of enlightenment in future lifetimes is
going to be a major motivation for most Westerners, and most will want
to know what their chances are for this lifetime. I have not seen any
studies which would answer this question, but my sense of it is that
most people who are properly motivated will be successful. Even so,
almost everyone has some degree of doubt at one time or another.</p>
<p>The problem with doubt is that if it becomes obsessive, it can be
self-fulfilling. The most effective method for dealing with doubt is
simply to become mindful of your doubt. When you observe that you are
experiencing doubt, you simply say to yourself, “I am having doubt”, and
then go on with your meditation practice, study or whatever you were
doing. Be careful not to cultivate excessive doubt or you will create a
mind state where you will not be able to objectively evaluate your
potential. The Buddha always encouraged questions and investigation, but
he warned about the danger of excessive doubt. If you ever find yourself
having obsessive doubt, it is probably better to discuss it with someone
rather than to trying to suppress it.</p>
</section>
<section id="arbitrary-models">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.2. </span>Arbitrary models<a class="headerlink" href="#arbitrary-models" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the things that can contribute to excessive doubt is failing to
see that there are people who have been successful in becoming
enlightened. There have been many successes, not only in the time of the
Buddha and Asia, but in the present, here in the West. Usually, people
fail to see this because they cling to false models of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Misunderstandings about what the enlightened can and cannot do, or
should and should not do, have existed since the time of the Buddha.
About ten percent of the Dhammapada is comprised of poems that the
Buddha composed when explaining or commenting on the actions of
Arahants. People would come to the Buddha complaining that a blind
Arahant was stepping on ants, and the Buddha explained that the
Arahant’s mind was free of the intent to kill. A nun was raped and not
upset, so some assumed she must have enjoyed it, but the Buddha
explained that she was an Arahant and was beyond sexual craving. A monk
had an odd way of jumping over streams, but the Buddha said that
although he was an Arahant, his style of jumping was the result of
previous lifetimes.</p>

<section id="conforming-to-ideals">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.3. </span>Conforming to ideals<a class="headerlink" href="#conforming-to-ideals" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A natural tendency is to assume that since enlightenment is an ideal,
then people who are enlightened will live up to your ideals. You might
expect that the enlightened would have haloes, be beautiful, graceful,
pleasing, healthy, intelligent, neat, reasonable and have psychic
powers, but none of these are standards for enlightenment. Now, as in
the time of the Buddha, people fail to recognize the enlightened around
them because they have artificial expectations. The Buddha spoke of this
in the Dhammapada:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>64</strong></div>
<div class="line">Fools may live all their lives</div>
<div class="line">In the company of the enlightened</div>
<div class="line">And still not see the dharma.</div>
<div class="line">As a spoon does not taste soup.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>65</strong></div>
<div class="line">The wise may know the enlightened</div>
<div class="line">For only a moment</div>
<div class="line">And still see the dharma</div>
<div class="line">As the tongue tastes soup.</div>
</div>
<p>During the years that I was doing intensive practice at the Insight
Meditation Society, I was surprised that a number of people thought that
none of the teachers were enlightened, or that no one ever gets
enlightened at IMS. I should explain that although retreats are
conducted in silence, people are allowed to talk for half a day at the
end of short retreats. I would take advantage of these brief periods to
find out all sorts of things.</p>
<p>My discussions with people indicated that many were using all sorts of
standards for evaluating enlightenment that had nothing to do with
enlightenment. The most common assumption would be that their
personality would fade away. One of the surprising results of Brown &amp;
Engler’s research into changes after the first level of enlightenment
was that personality profiles became exaggerated. They gave a series of
personality tests before and after three months of intensive meditation.
The subjects that the teachers suggested may have attained the first
level of enlightenment had higher scores after the retreat on many
characteristics measured.</p>

<section id="id2">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.4. </span>Belief in self<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps people expect personality to fade away because the belief
in self is supposedly lost after the first level of enlightenment. It
might be more accurate to say that the old belief in self is replaced
with a new belief in self. Self definition tends to change from being
someone who is in control of the situation to seeing self as being a
process of cause and effect. One way of describing this is to say that
the view of self is a collection of natural, selfless processes which
obey natural laws. Another insight into how the definition of self
changes is a marked tendency to define self as an energy pattern in some
psychological tests.</p>

<section id="psychic-powers">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.5. </span>Psychic powers<a class="headerlink" href="#psychic-powers" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A common expectation that people have is that the enlightened will have
psychic powers. The Buddha’s discourses contain many stories of the
Buddha, Arahants and Non-returners manifesting psychic powers such as
healing, mind reading, knowledge of the past &amp; future, teleportation,
identic memory flying and other phenomena. There are even many stories
in modern times of people who have manifested psychic powers.</p>
<p>One of my teachers, Dipa Ma Barua, was trained to develop psychic powers
by Munindra while she was at the Mahasi Sayadaw monastery in Burma.
Munindra had a book which described the methods to develop all the
standard psychic powers. After Dipa Ma had attained the third level of
enlightenment, he instructed her to develop all the powers in the book
She very quickly was able to master and demonstrate all of them.</p>
<p>Dipa Ma was following the instructions of her teacher to develop psychic
powers, but she thought that it was not appropriate to make use of them.
The manifestation of psychic powers can very easily take on the air of a
circus performance, and the importance of enlightenment can get lost.
After mastering all of the powers, she renounced all of them except the
power of <em>metta. Metta</em> is the development of a profound feeling of
unconditional love. One of the reasons that Dipa Ma was such an
outstanding teacher was that coming into her presence was like entering
a tangible field of love. Her students were inspired to work very hard
on their practice for her.</p>
<p>Although Dipa Ma had ostensively renounced psychic powers, she would
spontaneously use some of them in the course of teaching. From time to
time she would ask me if I had a specific experience in my practice that
day, and then give me specific instructions regarding it. Sometimes she
would give me special instructions regarding phenomena which would occur
within a day after she gave them. On a few occasions, I was aware that
she was doing healings for people that came to see her, but it seemed
that there was an effort being made not to advertise that this was
happening.</p>
<p>Several of my teachers would occasionally manifest a psychic awareness
of things that I had been thinking about, or that happened to me that
related to my meditation practice. On many occasions, I have been given
special instructions and comments concerning my practice that were both
unusual and exceptionally appropriate. These occasions are not arranged,
and they arise and pass very quickly. Most of the times they are done in
such a subtle way that even an interpreter may be unaware that anything
unusual is happening. Many of my friends have had similar experiences,
so the manifestation of teaching powers is very common, but not public.</p>
<p>Psychic powers are generally regarded as a dangerous sidetrack, and most
Buddhist teachers will actively discourage their students from trying to
develop them. The time and effort to develop psychic powers could be
better used to develop enlightenment. Also, it is very easy for people
to have a natural tendency to be entranced with powers. A teaching
situation could very quickly degenerate into a sideshow if too much
emphasis were placed on manifesting powers.</p>
<p>An occasional random psychic experience can add interest and authority
to a teacher if it is done appropriately. There is some danger that
people will choose teachers on the basis of manifested powers and ignore
even better teachers who are more discreet. People who will not
recognize someone as being enlightened unless she/he manifests psychic
powers are making a mistake. There is nothing in the list of
characteristics of enlightenment that requires the possession of psychic
powers.</p>

<section id="higher-levels-of-enlightenment">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.6. </span>Higher levels of enlightenment<a class="headerlink" href="#higher-levels-of-enlightenment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>I am not aware of any psychological tests that might support this, but
the mind becomes more sensitive and changeable with each level of
enlightenment. It would seem that this is partly a result of being able
to let go of a mind state more quickly. If you are able to let go of one
mind state, then almost instantly another mind state will arise. If this
ability is combined with the ability to consciously perceive processes
which were previously unconscious, then the mind becomes more volatile.</p>
<p>It is this increase in sensitivity and volatility which makes each level
of enlightenment more difficult to attain. It takes essentially the same
degree of concentration to attain <em>deep insight</em> into each new level
of enlightenment and to progress to attainment. Because the mind is more
sensitive, there is a greater probability that a mind object will arise
which will disrupt the concentration. A similar phenomenon occurs when
in the final phases of equanimity just before the attainment of Nirvana,
when new deep areas of unconscious processes are encountered. Usually
meditators working on higher paths progress very rapidly, a few days or
hours, from <em>deep insight</em> to the attainment of Nirvana and the higher
level of enlightenment. However, it is not uncommon for some to progress
very rapidly to final phases of the path in equanimity, and then spend
long periods, even years, in the final phase of equanimity just before
experiencing Nirvana. The higher the level of enlightenment being worked
on, the more likely this problem will occur. If they stop intensive
practice before attaining Nirvana, they will most likely lose the
progress they made and have to develop <em>deep insight</em> again on their
next retreat. They will then have to progress to where they left off on
their previous retreat. I suppose we can call this one of the
embarrassments of enlightenment.</p>
</section>
<section id="advanced-training">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.7. </span>Advanced Training<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-training" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The proper development of advanced forms of practice is the key to
attaining higher levels of enlightenment. The availability of this
training might be a factor to consider if you are thinking of doing long
term intensive practice. For example, the structure of the schedule at
IMS almost precludes proper preparation for higher levels of
enlightenment by closing for two weeks shortly after the annual
three-month retreat.</p>
<p>In advanced forms of practice, the teacher should observe carefully the
student’s practice after the first level of enlightenment is reached.
There should be signs that the student is spontaneously having repeated
experiences of Nirvana. This requires teachers with considerable skill
and experience as there are seven types of meditation phenomena which
can be mistaken for Nirvana. Once it is established that the student is
having experiences of Nirvana, then the teacher should begin a series of
exercises to develop a great proficiency in controlling this experience.
It can take several months of continuous intensive practice to develop
an acceptable minimum level of proficiency to maintain this ability in
daily life after leaving intensive practice. The best time to begin
developing this ability is as soon as possible after the first level of
enlightenment has been obtained. When adequate proficiency has been
developed, the teacher instructs the student to renounce having the
experience of Nirvana. <em>Deep insight</em> into a higher level of
enlightenment will soon occur.</p>

<section id="the-probability-of-attaining-higher-levels">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.8. </span>The probability of attaining higher levels<a class="headerlink" href="#the-probability-of-attaining-higher-levels" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>I haven’t seen any statistics on the attainment of higher levels of
enlightenment, and structuring an accurate estimate is difficult. Since
adequate advanced training is not generally available in the West, it
makes it difficult to estimate the probability of attaining higher
levels of enlightenment I have had little success in getting even rough
statistical estimates from a number of Asian meditation masters. The
Southeast Asian mind just does not seem to think statistically. Usually,
no matter how carefully I structure my questions, the answers boil down
to either yes or no.</p>
<p>Having said this I can say that it seems that the majority of people who
attain the first level of enlightenment and continue their practice can
attain the second level of enlightenment. Some people who attain the
first level of enlightenment are satisfied, and simply do not pursue
their practice further. Some people who have not had advanced training
will spontaneously develop <em>deep insight</em> to a higher path.
However, only a small percentage of people who attain the second level
will attain the third level. There also seems to be a big drop between
the number who get to the fourth level from the third. The best we can
determine from studying the Buddha’s discourses is that there seemed to
be a similar distribution of attainment in the Buddha’s time. The main
difference is that a larger percentage of people in the time of the
Buddha seemed to be attaining the first level. Although Arahants were
more plentiful in the time of the Buddha, it seems that there were not
proportionally more of them among those who attained the first level.</p>
</section>
<section id="reasonable-and-rational">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.9. </span>Reasonable and rational?<a class="headerlink" href="#reasonable-and-rational" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The most frequent reason that people would come to the Buddha with
complaints about Arahants was that they felt that the Arahants were not
being reasonable or rational. This is a variation on the subject of
expecting the enlightened to live up to arbitrary models, but I feel
this subject needs some special attention. Meditation is
psychotherapeutic, but not all neuroses will be eliminated until the
final phase of enlightenment, and some characteristics of personality
may become exaggerated by enlightenment.</p>
<p>One of the most appealing prospects to Westerners is that Buddhist
meditation offers an effective and inexpensive form of psychotherapy.
Buddhism is primarily entering the mainstream of Western culture through
psychotherapists. Usually, psychotherapists are the largest professional
group at Buddhist meetings, meditation retreats or events. A poll at one
three-month retreat that I attended found that half of the retreatants
were psychotherapists.</p>
<p>Buddhist meditation is certainly psychotherapeutic, but there are some
problems with regarding it as a form of psychotherapy. The first is that
too much emphasis on psychological phenomena will derail the process of
simply observing phenomena without trying to change anything. The second
is that in terms of psychotherapy, results are random, and it is unwise
to expect specific psychotherapeutic results from the practice. The
third is that the level of the unconscious where mental illness
originates is the deepest level. This level is not accessed until the
final level of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Although there are many reports of neuroses, phobias and obsessions
which have been spontaneously cured during meditation, usually there is
no way to predict in advance if and when they will be cured. Even
general personality changes as a result of attaining different levels of
enlightenment are erratic. Some people have a very profound change in
personality as a result of attaining the first level, and others do not.
In terms of therapeutic cures, you can expect that the first level would
result in a significant reduction in irrational behavior which is
immoral. It is unlikely for people who have attained the first level of
enlightenment to be murderers, liars, thieves, adulterers, or
alcoholics. A common report is that although neuroses can exist at the
first level of enlightenment, there is a sense of space behind the
neuroses. Although neurotic anger may be expressed, there is an
impression that the anger can be observed as an impersonal process, and
stream-winners are not 100% lost in it. This is difficult to quantify or
qualify, but my guess is that a study of outbursts of anger would show
that they are shorter and that amends for outbursts would more likely be
made.</p>
<p>A paradox here is that a stream-winner is likely to be more sensitive,
volatile and spontaneously expressive. The classic Commentaries of
Buddhism say that both lust and aversion are not reduced until the
second level of enlightenment, and not eliminated until the third level.
There may be some reduction of lust and anger-aversion at the first
level, but it might be counter balanced by the volatility of
personality.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, personality profiles after the first level of
enlightenment become exaggerated, and this is probably because of
sensitivity and volatility. Personalities seem to become more
exaggerated with each level of enlightenment, and I haven’t met an
Arahant that wasn’t a unique caricature. It is difficult to draw the
line between neuroses and characteristics of personality. In any case,
it seems that neurotic behavior may become exaggerated, although I am
unaware of anyone becoming generally more neurotic as a result of
meditation.</p>
<p>My teacher, Sayadaw U Pandita, once said, “Because of habit patterns, it
is possible for an Arahant to be obnoxious. However, the difference with
Arahants is that, if it is pointed out to them that they are being
obnoxious, they are capable of reflecting on situations and changing
their behavior.” I am certainly glad he said that, because U Pandita can
be quite obnoxious sometimes. His only interest seems to be that people
get enlightened, and he does not seem to care if people like him. There
are a number of things he will do, especially in private interviews,
that are calculated to irritate people if they are not being mindful. He
once confided to students of his, who were teachers, that he frequently
pretends to totally ignore a student during their interview by reading a
book, or doing something else. He said that this was a pretense, and he
really is watching them very carefully. Sometimes he is quite sarcastic
or brutal in his comments about reports on practice that people give
him. At his 1984 IMS retreat, 25% of the class of teachers and advanced
students dropped out of the three-month-course because his teaching was
too difficult for them.</p>

<section id="being-rational">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.10. </span>Being rational<a class="headerlink" href="#being-rational" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Another thing that U. Pandita said was, “Until the mind is purified of
all defilements, it is possible that even one defilement can be
activated and overcome consciousness.” This is worth remembering when
evaluating how rational the enlightened seem. Even Non-returners have
the defilements of: subtle craving for material realms, subtle craving
for immaterial realms, restlessness, conceit and the last veil of
unknowing. It is theoretically possible that although great progress has
been made in purifying the mind, individual circumstances may
chronically aggravate a particular neurosis. When we evaluate the
behavior of the enlightened, we should keep in mind that rationality and
reasonableness are not standards for evaluating enlightenment. The
tendency is for the personality to be exaggerated, and individual
characteristics should be considered.</p>

<section id="standards-of-the-theravada-commentaries">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.11. </span>Standards of the Theravada Commentaries<a class="headerlink" href="#standards-of-the-theravada-commentaries" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the most embarrassing controversies in Theravada Buddhism is
whether or not a stream-winner, or higher, would ever break a precept. I
touched on this subject in the chapter on Saints. The precepts are: 1)
Not to kill any sentient being; 2) Speak only the truth and never lie;
3) Not to steal or take anything which is not freely offered; 4) Not to
engage in sexual misconduct; 5) Not to take substances which dull the
consciousness.</p>
<p>I have mentioned before that the Southeast Asian mind seems to think in
terms of generalities, and does not seem to think in terms of
percentages or probabilities. Classical scholars give no wiggle room in
terms of adherence to precepts. They say that a stream-winner would not
take even a small sip of alcohol. One prominent scholar said that if a
stream-winner took a vow to fast and then took a drink of milk, the
solids would separate and only clear water would be consumed.</p>
<p>For years, I have had an opportunity to closely observe teachers and
meditators whom I believe have attained at least the first level of
enlightenment. They are mostly laypeople and Westerners, which is a
fundamentally different situation for monks and nuns who have a primary
duty of following precepts as a commitment to continuous mindfulness. In
my opinion, they have a very strong tendency to be highly moral and many
make a sincere effort to follow the precepts. Even those who make no
specific effort to follow the precepts are intuitively inclined to
follow them.</p>
<p>However, I have also observed that there have been occasions when,
because of neuroses, personality characteristics and cultural
conditioning, they would violate all or some of the five basic precepts.
At the Insight Meditation Society it was decided that overwhelming
infestations of cockroaches and flies were to be dealt with by
poisoning. Many would take a glass of wine at a party and some would
take psychedelic drugs on occasion. Some have failed to report income on
their tax returns. Some have answered questions falsely in meditation
interviews. Many have had sex with people they were not married to. Some
have taken food from the kitchen, that was not freely offered and eaten
it after the noon meal, while on retreat. Some have consciously or
unconsciously swatted mosquitos. According to the Commentaries, it would
be impossible for a stream-winner to do any of these things.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.12. </span>Differences in Eastern and Western logic.<a class="headerlink" href="#differences-in-eastern-and-western-logic" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There is a fundamental difference between Asian and Western scholarship,
and that is the primacy given ancient writings. A common view in all
Asian countries is that ancient writings are superior to modern
writings. A common Asian belief is that the world and culture is in a
state of continuous decline from a previous Golden Age when people lived
thousands of years in perfect harmony and health, and there was no war,
crime, disease nor insanity. It is believed that scholars had perfect
understandings of things that are no longer understood properly. It is
also believed that this decline will continue in the future when things
will get worse until eventually a new Golden Age will come.</p>
<p>Traditional Asian scholars will give the highest authority to the oldest
books. As it was in the West during the middle ages, a statement in an
ancient book is given higher authority than empirical observations. The
scientific method is now entering Asian culture, but it has not yet
affected traditional scholarship. Statements in the Buddhist
Commentaries were based on logical deductions from Buddhist psychology,
and in some cases on personal observations or conclusions of the ancient
scholars. If someone behaves contrary to the description of enlightened
behavior in the Commentaries, then traditionally that person is regarded
as not being enlightened.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.13. </span>Clear thinking and correct thinking<a class="headerlink" href="#clear-thinking-and-correct-thinking" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>It is unthinkable to a traditional Buddhist scholar that the Buddha
would ever make a mistake. The Buddha believed that one cause of
earthquakes was that land is floating on a sea and winds on the sea
cause big waves which shake the land. A scholar explained to me that
there are four elements in the Buddhist scheme of things: fire, earth,
air and water. The wind is regarded as energy in this system. Since
earthquakes are a release of energy, the Buddha was correct in saying
that the wind was the cause of earthquakes. This explanation seems to me
to have more rationalization than logic.</p>
<p>I believe that it is more important that the Buddha thought clearly,
rather than he thought correctly. If a computer is supplied incorrect
information, it will supply incorrect answers. This is no reflection on
the ability of the computer to function correctly. On a number of
occasions it seems to me that Arahants have made mistakes based on
incorrect information. One Arahant instructed his followers to build a
huge pagoda in California which was far beyond their financial
resources. Another Arahant said that the reason there were commercials
in the middle of movies on TV was that people were unable to concentrate
so long without a break. To me, it is more important that Arahants are
able to change their minds when presented with correct information, than
that they believe erroneous facts. It seems reasonable to me that if an
Arahant can make a mistake because of incorrect information, then a
Buddha could too. This is contrary to traditional Buddhist belief.</p>

<p>Whenever Buddhism enters a new culture, it takes on some of the
characteristics of that culture. The scientific method of questioning
and testing beliefs with new information is a very strong characteristic
of Western culture. The Buddhism that takes root in the West is very
likely to have a basis in tested and proven facts and concepts. Although
some cherished beliefs are likely to fall, Buddhism should emerge from
this process much stronger, and with deep roots in our culture. It will
probably be the only ancient religion that can largely survive the
rigorous questioning and testing of the scientific method, and become
integrated with mainstream thinking. We are very likely to come up with
a different definition as to what enlightenment is, and how to judge
whether or not someone is enlightened. It is also possible that
enlightenment may become as widely a cherished ideal as getting a good
education. Perhaps we may enter a new Golden Age.</p>

<p>One of my teachers was a student of Anagarika Munindra, and he spent
many years studying with him in India. During this time Munindra would,
making an Asian attempt at statistics, frequently mention in his talks,
“It only takes ten weeks to get enlightened.” After a few years of
hearing Munindra say this, he was getting quite worried. Eventually he
was successful and has become an outstanding teacher. However, a
characteristic of his teaching is to make no here and now type
references to people attaining enlightenment.</p>
<p>Once it becomes obvious that some people are getting enlightened, there
is a risk that those who are not enlightened will become embarrassed
because they are not. They may become embarrassed because they may have
done long periods without success. Some people might be embarrassed
because they have not become enlightened in a ten-day retreat. Some
might be embarrassed because they believe their friends have become
enlightened, and they have not, and some people might be embarrassed
because they are status conscious achievers.</p>
<p>Even in the time of the Buddha, there were great variations in the
amount of time that it took people to attain enlightenment The
charioteer who took the Buddha-to-be on his first trips into the world,
later became one of the Buddha’s monks. However, he did not attain even
the first level of enlightenment until after the Buddha died. The Buddha
taught for 45 years, and the charioteer had the Buddha for a teacher.
Another case from the time of the Buddha was of a monk who practiced
continuously for 65 years before attaining the first level of
enlightenment. The fastest student of the Buddha was a man who attained
all four levels as the Buddha gave him the following brief discourse:
“In the seen, there is just the seen. In the heard, there is just the
heard. In taste, there is just taste. In the felt, there is just the
felt. In smell, there is just smell. In the thought, there is just the
thought.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Buddhist etiquette makes enlightenment a private, personal
matter. I will be discussing this in greater detail in the chapter on
<em>The Etiquette of Enlightenment</em>. Many teachers will not even directly
discuss with their students whether or not they have attained
enlightenment. However, it seems common all over the world that people
who have done long periods of practice together, and have been
successful, will have an intuitive awareness of which of their friends
have been successful. They will discretely discuss their attainments
with close friends that they are sure have had similar experiences.</p>

<section id="enlightened-teachers">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.16. </span>Enlightened teachers<a class="headerlink" href="#enlightened-teachers" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Except when it relates to status of a teacher, the enlightened do not
seem to feel that there is any particular social status in their
enlightenment. I haven’t seen any trend among the enlightened to choose
their friends, or even spouses, based on enlightenment. The Buddha spoke
of the enlightened as having a high status, and he urged both
enlightened and unenlightened to hang out with the enlightened. There is
wisdom in this advice, but the enlightened do not seem to have a
particular inclination for it. Anyone who wants to attain enlightenment
with the goal of achieving some social status, other than being a
teacher, is pursuing an illusion.</p>
<p>Actually, there is little guarantee that someone teaching Buddhist
meditation is enlightened. The Buddha indicated a preference that
teachers be enlightened, and most teachers follow this standard before
encouraging their students to teach. However, the Buddha established no
system for qualifying teachers, so there is uneven application of this
standard in Buddhism as a whole. Some people who are teaching think that
they are enlightened, but are not, and are empowering their students to
teach. Although there should be some concern about this situation, I
personally am not too concerned, because in the long run, more people
will be drawn to the enlightened teachers. Students will get better
results with enlightened teachers.</p>

<section id="enlightenment-and-attainment">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.17. </span>Enlightenment and attainment<a class="headerlink" href="#enlightenment-and-attainment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There are a couple of other things that should be said about the desire
to attain enlightenment: Enlightenment really isn’t an attainable,
therefore a wrong effort to attain it could block its attainment. I
suppose this statement sounds Zen, but the point that I want to make is
that there is a difference between conventional language and technical
language. Perhaps it is a sloppy rule, but meditation teachers giving
meditation instructions are using technical language. When meditation
teachers are talking about ideas, philosophy, or anything else, they are
using conventional language. A parallel to this could be a physicist
speaking technically about his car being empty fields of energy patterns
and then saying, “Be careful not to run over the garbage can!”</p>
<p>Technically, there should be no effort to attain anything when doing
<em>vipassana</em> meditation. It is essential to settle back into a profound
examination of the present moment. Any effort to attain something will
focus your attention on that which does not exist, and you will not be
able to penetrate into the true reality of the present moment. Sometimes
I tell my students, “The only way to get to the next step is to be 100%
with the step you are on.” Sometimes even the subtlest anticipation of
what is going to happen next in the practice can block progress.</p>
<p>Although technically there should be no effort to attain anything in
<em>vipassana</em> meditation, the attainment of enlightenment is a very
worthwhile and difficult objective. It is highly recommended to take on
the attainment of enlightenment as the most important objective of a
lifetime. It is not easy to arrange your life to do a three-month
retreat, but it is worth doing even if it involves considerable effort
and sacrifice. You should be careful that an attitude of effort to
attain in the conventional sense does not creep into your practice in a
technical sense.</p>
<p>The creeping of unskillful attitudes into meditation practice can be a
major problem. I know several people who have made the attainment of
enlightenment the most important part of their lives, and have done many
long retreats over many years without success. I get the impression that
a common denominator which many of these people have is a quality of
grasping in their personality. I have often suspected that a tendency to
grasp experiences creeps into their practice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, people who have done long periods of practice without
attainments do feel that the practice of meditation has been beneficial
to them. Even people who have done more than ten years of intensive
practice before attaining the first level of enlightenment feel that the
time they spent has been very worthwhile.</p>
<p>There is one big advantage to taking a long time to attain
enlightenment, and that is people who do so seem to make better
teachers. They are better able to identify with and help people who are
having problems with their practice. One of my teachers likened this to
a monk who went into a village seeking alms with his begging bowl. He
became lost in the village and people kept giving him food. By the time
he found his way back to the monastery, he had enough food to provide a
feast for the other monks.</p>
<p>Regardless of how long it takes to attain enlightenment, it is not
appropriate to compare yourself to others. Some people are going to be
fast, and other people are going to be slow. You are going to be
whatever you are going to be, and it is not a race. Enlightenment is a
noncompetitive activity, and it is possible for everyone to win. One of
my favorite quotes from Munindra is, “The Buddha’s enlightenment solved
his problem. You must solve your problem.” How long it takes someone
else has no relevance to how long it will take you.</p>

<p>One truly embarrassing situation, which is common, is that
sometimes people think they are enlightened, and they are not. There are
a number of reasons people mistakenly think that they are enlightened:
the most common reason is mistaking experiences in meditation practice
for enlightenment; and neurotics may imagine that they are enlightened
for a variety of psychological reasons. Of course psychopaths may simply
claim to be enlightened.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.19. </span>The calm and concentrated mind<a class="headerlink" href="#the-calm-and-concentrated-mind" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>However, there is value in understanding the common experience of
mistaking experiences in the practice for enlightenment. One of these
experiences is when a meditator first experiences a very calm
concentrated mind. It is said that the first three insights a meditator
has are: 1) The mind is in a state of turmoil; 2) It seems impossible to
stop or control this turmoil; 3) It has always been this way and we did
not know it. After these insights have been experienced, it is possible
that deep concentration can develop. The mind becomes very clear,
powerful and objects can be seen vividly. You can look at a tree and see
it as you never have before. Instead of seeing the tree through a fog of
discursive thought, fear and desire for the past and future, you simply
see a vivid, beautiful image of a tree. You see subtleties of color,
texture and shape in a profound new way. The mind is cool, quiet and
peaceful as you have never experienced before. It is truly a profound,
wonderful state of mind. This is it! This must be the wonderful
indescribable experience of <em>Nirvana!</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, this is not <em>Nirvana</em>: <em>Nirvana</em> is even better than this.
Sometimes people hold on to this concentrated state of mind for the rest
of the retreat. When they go home, and are confronted with the
complexities of real life, this clear state of mind will shatter like a
pane of glass. The buzzing fog of confusion returns to their minds, and
they are quite likely to become upset or depressed that peace and
clarity have vanished.</p>
<p>This clear concentrated state of mind is part of the normal evolution of
meditation practice. This is actually the development of <em>samatha</em>
meditation, or pure concentration of mind. It is the preliminary to
developing true <em>vipassana</em> meditation. As I have mentioned
previously, it is necessary to develop concentration before <em>vipassana</em>.
The recent rediscovery is that it is possible to simultaneously
develop both <em>samatha</em> and <em>vipassana</em> has resulted in a revival of
practice in Theravada Buddhism. However, even when <em>samatha</em> and
<em>vipassana</em> are being simultaneously cultivated, <em>samatha</em> develops
first.</p>
<p>The word <em>vipassana</em> is sometimes defined as <em>seeing things clearly</em>.
However, when we get into a study of the derivation of this word, the
meaning is <em>to see things clearly with great power and penetrating
examination.</em> Objects can be seen clearly with just <em>samatha,</em> but
with the penetrating power of <em>vipassana</em> added to <em>samatha,</em> the
true nature of objects can be seen clearly. When the true nature of
objects is seen clearly, they will have the characteristics of change,
of being unsatisfactory and of emptiness. These characteristics will be
seen consecutively, in this order, as the practice evolves.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.20. </span>The Progress of Insight<a class="headerlink" href="#the-progress-of-insight" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>In <em>vipassana</em> meditation, the object of meditation is not
particularly important. What is important is the way the objects are
perceived. The most common primary objects for <em>vipassana</em> are
changing objects such as the breath or the body, especially movement of
the body during walking meditation. The most common objects for <em>samatha</em>
are fixed visual objects such as colored disks mounted on the wall or
a candle flame. As <em>samatha</em> develops, objects become more vivid,
solid and real. Even though the objects of <em>vipassana</em> are changing,
the first component to develop is <em>samatha.</em> After <em>samatha</em> is
adequately developed, a sudden shift occurs in the practice which is
called <em>deep insight.</em> At this point the practice technically shifts
into <em>mahavipassana,</em> and the primary impression of objects changes
from solid reality to changing discontinuity of objects.</p>
<p>It is <em>deep insight</em> that is most commonly mistaken for enlightenment.
Previously the mind had been focused into a one pointed place. When the
mind shifts into the overdrive of <em>mahavipassana,</em> suddenly the mind
takes on a perception of space, with objects arising and passing within
space. The mind is flooded with profound insights into the true nature
of reality, the laws of <em>karma,</em> and frequently, but not always, there
are lights and visions which reflect and symbolize these insights.
Suddenly, there is a deep experiential comprehension of what before had
been just philosophical understandings of the <em>dharma.</em> The change is
so profoundly different and wonderful, that many think, “This certainly
must be enlightenment.”</p>
<p>Although many suspect that they have experienced enlightenment at this
point, there are also reasons to suspect that this is not enlightenment.
Very likely the mind is in a state of revolution and turmoil. The mind
before had been quiet and peaceful, but now it is flooded with
innumerable objects that are constantly changing. But after awhile the
mind again settles down to observing the continuous flow of arising
objects. As the mind settles down to a strong practice, the suspicion
may again arise that enlightenment has been attained. Sometimes the
energy and concentration are strong enough that meditators can sit for
hours without moving.</p>
<p>However, there is another shift in the practice as the emphasis abruptly
changes to the passing of objects from consciousness. The exhilaration
of the practice vanishes. Thoughts and images of death, disease and
decay are likely to arise. The mind is colored with fear, dread and
uncertainty. It is difficult to sit even an hour, and the mind tends to
wander as objects vanish from the mind. After this, the mind and body
seem to become a mass of suffering, and the meditator is willing to let
go of all attainments in the practice, including the idea of
enlightenment.</p>
<p>Again there is a shift in the practice. A great peace arises in the mind
as the meditator is able to observe the flow of empty phenomena passing
through consciousness. As this phase of the practice deepens, equanimity
becomes profound, and the meditator may again be able to sit for hours
without moving. At this time, the meditator may be able to temporarily
experience the quality of mind of an Arahant. The mind is so clear and
powerful, that again thoughts may arise that enlightenment has been
attained. It has not, but it is close.</p>
<p>If intensive meditation practice is interrupted at this point, the
conscious access to formerly unconscious processes will be lost. There
will be some permanent changes in attitude and philosophy as a result of
insights that have occurred. Meditators will retain a profound respect
for the dharma, their teachers and the potential of meditation. They
will have a change in self definition, and will know that only their own
work purifying their minds will be their salvation. Their practice will
be much stronger in daily life, and they will have a strong urge to
return to intensive practice and work on themselves.</p>
<p>If intensive practice is continued at some point, they will have an
experience of <em>Nirvana. It</em> is an interesting point to ponder as to
whether <em>Nirvana</em> changes the mind, or the experience of <em>Nirvana</em>
occurs because the mind has made a fundamental change. In any case,
the first brief glimpse of <em>Nirvana</em> represents a fundamental shift in
consciousness. The first stratum of the unconscious mind is now
permanently accessible to the consciousness even after the <em>high</em> of
the retreat has worn off. The first level of enlightenment has been
attained. New ways to be embarrassed about enlightenment can now be
experienced.</p>

<section id="they-do-not-know">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.21. </span>They do not know<a class="headerlink" href="#they-do-not-know" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>I have discussed the confusion which may arise as to whether or not
enlightenment has been attained as certain experiences in the practice
occur. Some people will decide that they are enlightened when they are
not. Others will not be able to decide whether or not they are
enlightened. This inability to decide can sometimes continue even after
enlightenment has been attained.</p>
<p>Usually this occurs in situations where teachers do not want to openly
discuss with their students their level of attainment. The primary
reason for this is the general trend to regard enlightenment as a
personal and private matter even between student and teacher. Some
teachers may not be absolutely sure of exactly what level of attainment
their students have made. Other teachers may feel confident that they
can appraise their students progress, but simply do not want to take
time in interviews discussing anything other than meditation
instructions.</p>
<p>Even from the viewpoint of an experienced teacher, it is not always easy
to determine exactly what is happening in some students’ practice. There
is a tremendous variety of individual responses to the same level of
development as well as different ways that people can report similar
phenomena. Sometimes psychological problems arise in the practice which
obscure developments in the practice. However, after teachers have
worked with students for long continuous periods, they usually have a
good idea of their level of development. Whether they are willing to
discuss their opinions with their students depends on the teacher.</p>
<p>In the Mahasi Sayadaw tradition, when teachers feel that their students
may have attained enlightenment, they are given a tape recording of
other students to listen to. The tape recording is of other students
describing their experience of the progress of insights leading up to
enlightenment. The students listening to the tape are told to compare
their experiences to the experiences described and decide for themselves
if they are enlightened. Being told to listen to the tape is regarded as
an opinion of the teacher that they are enlightened, which is probably
why teachers in the West do not follow this tradition. If teachers are
unwilling to discuss their evaluations of students’ practice, then it is
quite possible that the students may be confused about whether or not
they are enlightened.</p>

<p>The number of people who are enlightened, but are embarrassed because
they do not want to say that they are enlightened, is larger than the
group that do not know if they are enlightened. I will be discussing
this more in the chapter on the <em>Etiquette of Enlightenment,</em> but here
I want to say something about the feeling of embarrassment. The feeling
of embarrassment seems to come from, at least, these reasons: 1) There
is an expectation that people will have arbitrary expectations for them
to live up to. 2) It is difficult for them to describe what
enlightenment is like. 3) People tend to regard enlightenment as
something that has been acquired, when, in fact, nothing has been
acquired.</p>

<section id="living-up-to-expectations">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.23. </span>Living up to expectations<a class="headerlink" href="#living-up-to-expectations" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Back in the 1920’s, there was a circus performer who had an unusual act
of being shot in the stomach with a cannon ball. The cannon ball was an
unusually large hollow steel ball, so it was not exactly like being shot
by a regular cannon, but it was an impressive act. He did have unusually
strong stomach muscles, and when hit by the ball he was propelled
backward into a safety net. One day he was standing in line at a bank,
and an admirer came up and unexpectedly hit him in the stomach. His
stomach muscles were relaxed, and the blow ruptured his liver. He died
from internal bleeding.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, people tend to have all sorts of mistaken
ideal standards which they expect the enlightened to live up to. Some of
these standards could be dangerous, but in any event it is better not to
have to deal with them at all. Life is much safer and simpler
for the enlightened without public recognition.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.24. </span>Explaining the unexplainable<a class="headerlink" href="#explaining-the-unexplainable" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Another way that life is simpler for the enlightened is that if people
are not aware of their status, they do not have to explain the
unexplainable. Most people who become enlightened have a paradoxical
feeling that everything is fundamentally the same while at the same time
they have a feeling that everything is different. They have a great deal
of difficulty describing what the difference is before and after
enlightenment. Actually, one of the differences is that some processes
which were unconscious are now conscious. This is hard to describe
because all the conscious processes seem to be normal conscious
processes.</p>

<section id="progress-is-measured-by-loss">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.25. </span>Progress is measured by loss<a class="headerlink" href="#progress-is-measured-by-loss" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Another thing that is hard to describe is that enlightenment is more
like letting go of something than acquiring something. It is said that
spiritual gain is measured by loss. In the Hindu tradition this is
described as the higher realms of existence having fewer elements. There
are similar descriptions in the Buddhist tradition. In the practice of
meditation, teachers evaluate students’ progress in part by the loss of
certain characteristics. Paradoxically, as the mind becomes simpler, it
can perceive greater complexity.</p>
<p>It is difficult to describe the simplicity of seeing one’s self as a
cause and effect natural phenomenon. This is the result of letting go of
a previous definition of self as being inflexible and in control. The
previous definition involved all sorts of complex assumptions and
rationalizations, and the new definition is a simple natural flow of
energy. It seems better to just be, than to explain, and that is one of
the reasons that the enlightened seek no special status.</p>

<section id="partly-enlightened">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.26. </span>Partly enlightened<a class="headerlink" href="#partly-enlightened" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A subtle form of embarrassment comes from being partly enlightened but
not fully enlightened. Experiences in deep meditation have given even
stream-winners a taste of the potential of what it would be like to have
the mind free of defilements. At the same time, being partly enlightened
tends to increase awareness of the existence of neuroses and other
defilements of mind. An awareness of the potential and limitations of
the current state of mind result in humility that is a form of
embarrassment about being enlightened. Trungpa Rinpoche described this
as, “Clarity of mind does not result in a feeling of how good you are
now, but of how stupid you were before.” Even Arahants do not have a
sense of pride about their enlightenment. Conceit is one of the
defilements of mind that is eliminated by attaining the fourth level of
enlightenment.</p>

<section id="the-amount-of-time-they-have-meditated">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.3.27. </span>The amount of time they have meditated<a class="headerlink" href="#the-amount-of-time-they-have-meditated" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>From time to time people find themselves in an embarrassing situation
because they expect that someone who has done many years of practice
must be either enlightened or very enlightened. The opposite situation
can be true if they assume someone is not enlightened because they have
done very little meditation practice. As I indicated before, there is a
wide variation on how rapidly people progress in the practice. The
Buddha suggested that we could look for the results of being an Arahant
or a Non-returner when someone has done between seven days and seven
years of practice. In the time of the Buddha, there were cases of people
getting these results in less than a week, and some did not get any
results in much longer periods. The basic message is that we should be
open minded as to whether someone is, or is not enlightened, and it is
only important when evaluating teachers. Certainly, to avoid
embarrassment, you should avoid voicing any opinions to someone, or
about someone, as to whether or not they are enlightened, based on
practice they have done. It is a good idea to be discreet and follow the
guidelines in the chapter on <em>The Etiquette of Enlightenment.</em></p>

<section id="the-etiquette-of-enlightenment">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.4. </span>The Etiquette of Enlightenment<a class="headerlink" href="#the-etiquette-of-enlightenment" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Since enlightenment is such an important and embarrassing subject, we
should have a proper etiquette. Fortunately or unfortunately, there is
no universal etiquette for enlightenment, but each culture and situation
evolves its own customs. This is fortunate in that it allows each
culture, teacher, monastery or meditation center to evolve practices
which are appropriate for that situation. It is unfortunate in that the
etiquette is mostly unspoken and unexplained. Awkward situations are
likely to happen.</p>
<p>It seems that there are many similarities between the etiquette of
enlightenment and the etiquette of sex. Both are highly charged and
delicate personal subjects. If there is a group of people, and some of
them are sexually active, and others are not, it is unlikely that there
would be an open discussion of individuals’ sex lives. A meditation
retreat might have some similarities to a sex education class, but who
is getting it and who is not would still likely be a private matter. If
you had a problem or a question about your personal sex life, you might
talk about it with a teacher or friend. If you have friends whom you
feel have had similar experiences, you might go into great detail about
your personal experiences.</p>
<p>In the Theravada tradition, there are four great rules which, if broken,
require monks to disrobe, and they can not be monks again. The rules
involve: taking life, stealing, sex and claiming any attainment in
meditation which they do not have. Since there is always some
uncertainty about attainments, and mistakes are common, it is very rare
that a Theravada monk will make any type of claim. This tends to carry
over as a standard for nuns and laypeople even though there are no
official sanctions against them making erroneous claims.</p>
<section id="evolving-etiquette">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.4.1. </span>Evolving etiquette<a class="headerlink" href="#evolving-etiquette" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Because of the recent revival of meditation in Southeast Asia, social
customs concerning enlightenment are still evolving. In the early days
at the Mahasi Sayadaw monastery, Mahasi Sayadaw would give students a
certificate of attainment for Stream-winners. I have heard no
explanation as to why this practice was discontinued, but it seems that
there must have been some problems. Generally, at the Mahasi monastery
today there is no public discussion of specific individual attainments.</p>
<p>I have heard stories about the first teachers in other areas who would
openly discuss attainments of students. This seems to have developed
interest in people in that area to pursue the practice. After there is
sufficient public interest, it seems that the trend is for attainments
to be kept more confidential. No doubt problems will arise with people
mistaking their experiences in the practice for enlightenment, and some
people may simply start to make false claims. It seems that the natural
evolution would be that public awareness of attainments would be
inspirational at first, but later problems would make privacy
preferable.</p>
</section>
<section id="silence">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.4.2. </span>Silence<a class="headerlink" href="#silence" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the ways of acknowledging attainments is silence. Frequently
people would invite the Buddha to come to their houses to receive alms
food. It was the custom of the Buddha to remain silent when he assented.
Perhaps this was his way of avoiding breaking his word if circumstances
arose which kept the visit from happening. Anyway, people knew if he
remained silent that they could expect him to show up the next day.
Perhaps this is why some monks, nuns and teachers remain silent when
someone asks them if they are enlightened.</p>
<p>Tungpulu Sayadaw of Burma was one of the most widely recognized Arahants
of the twentieth century. I heard the following story about how it
became known that he was an Arahant: While he was meditating in his cave
for thirty-nine years, he would be visited by an old friend who had
practiced with him under the guidance of the same teacher. At first, he
asked Tungpulu if he had become a <em>Once-Returner,</em> and Tungpulu said
“No, I have not become a <em>Once-Returner.”</em> After a few years, he again
asked Tungpulu if he had become a <em>Once-Returner,</em> and he remained
silent. Then he asked him if he had become a <em>Non-Returner,</em> and
Tungpulu said, “No, I have not become a <em>Non-Returner.”</em> After a few
more years, he asked him if he had become a <em>Non-Returner,</em> and
Tungpulu remained silent. Then he asked him if he had become an Arahant,
and he said “No, I have not become an Arahant.” Finally, after many
years he asked him if he had become an Arahant, and Tungpulu remained
silent. Once a woman asked him in public if he was an Arahant. Tungpulu
raised up his hand to her indicating that she should not ask that
question.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-bodhisattva-vow">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.4.3. </span>The Bodhisattva Vow<a class="headerlink" href="#the-bodhisattva-vow" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Tungpulu Sayadaw was an unusual Theravadan because he announced that he
had taken The Bodhisattva Vow. This was after he was famous and had
established many monasteries. Many traditional Theravadans concluded
that he could not have attained even Stream-winner because a Bodhisattva
supposedly vows to delay enlightenment. This was paradoxical because he
was such an extraordinary teacher and had many enlightened students. It
is unlikely that an unenlightened teacher would have enlightened
students.</p>
<p>The Mahayana Bodhisattva Vow of delaying enlightenment until all beings
are enlightened is one of the most heated disputes between the Theravada
and Mahayana Buddhists. The Mahayanas view the Theravadans as being
selfish because they regard their own liberation more important than the
liberation of others. The Theravadans take the vow literally believing
it refers to <em>Stream-winning,</em> and point out that becoming enlightened
is the best way to help others become enlightened. If the vow refers to
<em>Stream-winning,</em> and if everyone delays their enlightenment until
everyone becomes enlightened, then logically no one will ever become
enlightened. Also, it seems questionable to take a vow that one cannot
comprehend. How long will it be until all sentient beings get
enlightened? How many sentient beings will have to get enlightened
first? Another complication is that some Buddhists believe that the
number of sentient beings is increasing.</p>
<p>The Mahayana Buddhists have different beliefs as to exactly what the
Bodhisattva Vow means, but many believe it refers only to not going into
<em>Parinirvana</em> which is the final phase of enlightenment. There are
many carefully documented and verified cases of Tibetan Arahants that
have taken this vow and have reincarnated. This seems a contradiction to
the Buddha’s claim that Arahants will not reincarnate. According to
Buddhist psychology, rebirth is the result of craving, and Arahants are
free of craving. However, compassion is a motivating factor in Arahants,
and it seems that they have substituted compassion for craving as a
cause of rebirth.</p>
<p>When Tungpulu Sayadaw came to teach at the Insight Meditation Society in
1984, I thought that he might be able to shed some light on the
disagreement between the Theravada and Mahayana Buddhists. I arranged a
private interview with him, but it was delayed until late at night. When
I came into the interview, the interpreter explained that since it was
so late, I would only be allowed one question. I had intended to ask two
questions, one of which was, “Why would it be impossible for an Arahant
to take a vow to reincarnate?” I elected to ask my other question about
mind moments. Tungpulu gave a lengthy answer to my one question.
Interestingly, he also to included an answer to my second unasked
question. He said “The reincarnation of Arahants is a paradox.” I
thought that was a particularly skillful answer because he avoided the
controversy of contradicting the traditional Theravada view by directly
saying that Arahants reincarnate. At the same time, he acknowledged that
Arahants can reincarnate by saying it was a paradox. If they did not
reincarnate, there would be no paradox.</p>
</section>
<section id="clues">
<h3><span class="section-number">4.4.4. </span>Clues<a class="headerlink" href="#clues" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>People who have spent long periods of time studying with a teacher are
quite likely to have picked up various clues as to the level of
attainment of the teacher. Most of these clues come from their teacher’s
talks when he/she illustrates certain experiences in
meditation with his/her own experiences. For example, one of my teachers
said that when he was practicing with his teacher, he sat with the vow
not to arise from his seat until his mind was free of all defilements.
Knowing how committed he was to following vows, and considering that he
arose from his seat, I felt safe in concluding that he was an Arahant,
free of all mental defilements. Based on this statement I could have
legitimately challenged him to deny he was an Arahant, but that would
have been rude. Very likely, he would have pretended to ignore the fact
that I asked him a question.</p>
<p>If you are interested in determining the level of attainment of
teachers, it would be impolite to ask them directly. However, you might
take an opportunity to discretely ask one of their senior students for
their opinion of the level of attainment of their teacher, and why they
believe it. Remember that enlightenment is generally a delicate, private
matter, and it is as sensitive as inquiring into someone’s sex life. At
the same time, the etiquette of enlightenment is a dynamic and changing
situation, and it is possible to push the edge. Discrete conversations
with your peers and senior students of teachers are an excellent way to
pick up clues.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">4.5. </span>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>It has become popular to remind people of an ancient Chinese curse, “May
you be born in interesting times.” Times are very interesting these days
with simultaneous revolutions in transportation, media, information
availability, as well as changes brought on by the end of the Cold War.
The teachings of all of the world’s great religions are now
simultaneously available for comparison for the first time. The
different traditions of Buddhism, which have evolved in isolation from
each other, are now simultaneously encountering each other for the first
time. There are research scientists who have not only been trained in
the Western scientific method, but who have also attained enlightenment,
and are able to do qualified research into the nature of enlightenment.
Enlightened scholars have not only been able to establish common
understanding between different Buddhist traditions, but also they have
found common threads of understanding in different types of religions.
It is a time of great ferment and change.</p>
<p>It is helpful to remind ourselves that living in times of change is not
only exciting, but it is also a curse. Times of spiritual change are
breeding grounds for both saints and psychopaths. Hopefully, I have
provided some basis for understanding both saints and psychopaths, and
given you some ability to distinguish which is which. There are extra
copies of the <strong>Checklist for Saints and Psychopaths</strong> on the last
pages of this book, and I suggest that you post them on a wall as a
reminder, or give them to friends. Reviewing this list from time to time
may save you and your friends a great deal of trouble in this time of
change.</p>
<p>I hope that the sharing of my personal spiritual journey will be of help
to others on the path of spiritual development. I was not eager to
reveal the mistakes that I have made, nor how psychopaths have taken
control of my life at times. However, the thought that honestly sharing
the mistakes that I have made may help others to avoid similar mistakes
made the decision easy.</p>
