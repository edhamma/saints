Anagami
   One who has attained the third level of enlightenment. The
   classic definition of an *Anagami* is that he or she has eliminated
   the mental defilements of lust and aversion, but still retains the five
   defilements of mind: 1) craving for subtle material realms, 2) craving
   for subtle immaterial realms, 3) conceit, 4) restlessness, 5) the final
   vil of unknowing or delusion.

Arahant
   A fully enlightened being. One who has uprooted all the
   defilements and experiences no more mental suffering. According to the
   Theravada tradition, just before death an Arahant will pass into and
   remain in Nirvana and will not be reborn in any form. According to the
   Mahayana tradition, Arahants may be reborn if they have made a vow to
   reincarnate to help other sentient beings attain enlightenment.

atta
   The Hindu concept of self as being an unchanging, immutable aspect
   of the consciousness of God. Enlightenment in this tradition is regarded
   as a transcendence of concepts which separate oneself from God.
   Ultimately, all separate self existence is relinquished, and all that
   remains is everything which is God. In both the Hindu and Buddhist
   tradition individual self existence ultimately ceases when one realizes
   fully that the individual self is only an illusion, and when one is able
   to transcend the craving which causes rebirth.

Commentaries
   In the 5th century A.D. Buddhaghosa, an Indian scholar in
   Sri Lanka, compiled and translated a great body of texts written
   in Sinhalese and Sanskrit into Pali. The Theravadans believe Buddhaghosa
   regarded the Buddha as the source of original thought, and the various
   explanatory texts as fortification of the teachings of the Buddha.
   Western scholars have suggested that Buddhaghosa must have simply
   translated any texts that were available as they range in quality from
   wonderfully insightful to trivial and erroneous. In any case, the body
   of Pali texts which were compiled became the basis for making Pali the
   scholarly language of the Theravada tradition in Southeast Asia.

contemplative
   As used in this book, *contemplative* refers to
   spiritual traditions which involve mental disciplines as opposed to
   disciplines which involve service, study, teaching, or work.

co-psychopath
   Co-psychopaths are close associates of psychopaths who
   are caught up in a web of control and deception. They may be a spouse,
   partner, student or disciple. They, themselves are usually not morally
   defective, but they have accepted the artificial reality that the
   psychopaths have created. Once they have developed some doubt about
   their psychopathic associate, they have an excellent chance of
   extricating themselves from their role. Usually to fully recover, they
   will need support and understanding from others who have had similar
   experiences.

deep insight
   An abbreviation of *Deep Insight into Arising and Passing
   of Phenomenon.* This occurs when concentration and the ability to
   observe change are developed to the point that thought processes can be
   observed to arise and pass in the mind. The nature of objects of
   consciousness appears to change, and a great energy and enthusiasm for
   meditation practice arises in the meditator. After deep insight, insight
   into faster and subtler components of the thought process is realized,
   and the meditator acquires an intuitive wisdom about the nature of
   consciousness and reality.

defilements of mind
   There are three basic defilements of the mind:
   greed, hatred-aversion, and delusion-confusion-unknowing. There are
   innumerable individual defilements which are permutations and
   combinations of the basic three such as: fear, sloth, conceit, jealousy,
   paranoia and resentment. The root cause of defilements is craving, or a
   strong preference for things to be a certain way such as, having what
   you want and not having an experience which you do not want. The mind is
   defiled when there is craving that is unconscious and determines
   behavior. Only Arahants are able to be conscious of the arising of the
   subtlest forms of craving.

Dhammapada
   The *Dhammapada* was compiled in Sri Lanka about 2,000
   years ago from the 100,000 page record of the Buddha's discourses.
   Occasionally during his discourses, the Buddha would make a point in
   spontaneous poetry. The *Dhammapada* is an anthology of some of these
   poems. Since the record of the discourses are chants of summaries, and
   since the poems could not be rendered into summaries, the *Dhammapada*
   contains the purest record of what the Buddha actually said.

dharma
   The natural law for any conditioned object. The truth. The
   teachings of the Buddha. Cause and effect. The way things are. Dharma is
   Sanskrit for the Pali word *dhamma.* It has a great range of
   meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Usually it
   applies to spiritual truths or laws. Sometimes it is used as a synonym
   for karma which is one aspect of the dharma. Generally, *dharma*
   refers to the natural law or the basic truth such as the law of
   gravity (also a dharma), and it is not strictly speaking a law, but the
   definition of a process. Dharma is not regarded in Buddhism as a law
   decreed by the Buddha or any deity.

Eight Fold Path
   The Buddha's basic teaching is the Eight Fold Path. It
   consists of eight things which if understood and done correctly will
   lead to enlightenment. They are: Right Understanding, Right Thought,
   Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right
   Mindfulness, Right Concentration. All of the Buddha's teachings are
   explanations and elaborations on these eight basic teachings.

enlightenment
   As used in this book, refers to having attained a stable
   access to the first stratum of the unconscious processes and corresponds
   to the level of stream-winner. The characteristics of clarity,
   compassion and intuitive wisdom deepen as access to deeper strata are
   attained. Arahants have the greatest access and are regarded as being
   fully enlightened.

*karma*
   Karma is the cause and effect relationship of how past
   actions condition our present experience. Karma is created by the
   volitional intentions of action, speech and thought and the effect they
   have on sentient beings. One's reality is the result of one's karma and
   is a composite of good and bad karma. Good karma results in pleasure.
   Bad karma results in suffering. Actions based on intentions to bring
   pleasure result in good karma. Actions based on intentions to bring harm
   bring suffering. Actions which result in good karma do not cancel out
   bad karma, but they do upgrade the mix.

LSD
   A powerful psychedelic drug, lysergic acid diethylamide, that alters
   consciousness and perception.

levels of enlightenment
   1) *Sotapanna*; 2) *Sakadagami*; 3) *Anagami*; 4) *Arahant.*

*Mahasatipatthana*
   A long discourse by the Buddha in the *Digha
   Nikayti* describing the basic principles of meditation and different
   forms of meditation practice. It is traditionally regarded as being a
   single discourse given in the market town of Karnmasadhamma. However, a
   study of the structure and content of the text indicates it was
   compilation on the subject of meditation from fragments of various
   discourses. The editor's apparent lack of skill in meditation seem to
   have created some odd combinations of topics based on words instead of
   how methods would be used in actual practice. It seems unlikely that a
   skillful teacher such as the Buddha would arrange his topics in such a
   way. It is possible that the Buddha expected that the details of
   meditation practice be taught individually and orally by a qualified
   teacher. This may be why his discourses contain so little specific
   information on meditation technique.

Mahayana
   Buddhists who take the Bodhisattva Vow to delay their
   enlightenment until all sentient beings attain enlightenment. The
   purpose is to remain in existence so that they can help to all other
   sentient beings attain enlightenment. Mahayana Buddhists have different
   interpretations of what this vow means, but many regard this as not
   entering *Parinirvana* where individual existence would cease. In the
   Mahayana tradition it is believed that the Bodhisattva vow makes it
   possible to override the limitations of rebirth that the Buddha
   described for different levels of enlightenment.

metta
   A meditation practice of systematically cultivating feelings of
   unconditional loving kindness. *Metta* is a concentration practice
   sometimes used in conjunction with, but not at the same time as
   *vipassana* meditation. *Metta* is a wish that all beings should be
   safe, happy and healthy. Advanced practitioners experience heavenly
   mental states, and sometimes have a profound positive effect on other
   beings.

nama-rupa
   Mind and matter. A stage of development in meditation
   practice when it becomes very clear that mind and matter are separate
   but interdependent.

Nirvana
   Sanskrit: lit, *Extinction* (nir+va to cease blowing, to
   become extinguished.) Nirvana is beyond time and space; therefore it has
   neither beginning nor end—birth nor death. One can enter into Nirvana
   and leave it, but Nirvana is always there and unchanging. The ultimate
   objective of Buddhism is to enter Nirvana and not leave it. Some of the
   synonyms the Buddha used for are Nirvana are: The Peaceful State,
   Deathless, Bliss Supreme, Stilling of Conditioned Things, Unconditioned,
   Uncreated, Unmade, Unoriginated, Unformed, Unborn, Uncompounded, The
   Way, Highest Goal, Fruit, Dharma, Happiness Supreme, That Beyond
   Happiness, Destruction of Conditioned Things, Gone Beyond. Nirvana is
   experienced briefly at the culmination of each path at the time that
   enlightenment or higher level of enlightenment is attained. Since there
   are no reference points in Nirvana to base a description
   on, any description of Nirvana is not a description of
   Nirvana.

Non-returner
   An Anagami. People who have attained the third level of
   enlightenment The Buddha gave them the name *Non-returners* because
   they will not be reborn again in this world as a human. They will
   experience one more birth in a formless heavenly realm of gods before
   they go into *Parinirvana.*

Pali
   Summaries of the Buddha's discourses were rendered into chants, and
   for two hundred years after the death of the Buddha, nearly the only
   record of what the Buddha said, was this oral tradition. Then King Asoka
   sponsored the writing of the Buddha's discourses into Pali, the language
   of his kingdom. Northern India was ruled by the kingdom of Magadha
   during the Buddha's lifetime, so it seems reasonable that the Buddha
   spoke Magadhi in public, and possibly at times spoke Sanskrit with
   scholars. Both Magadhi and Pali have very near roots in Sanskrit. The
   similarity of the three languages must have the advantage of
   transmitting subtle understanding as well as subtle misunderstandings.
   Traditionally, the Theravada view is that Pali is an absolutely accurate
   record of the Buddha's discourses, and the Pali Commentaries are
   accurate elaborations of the Buddha's teachings.

parinirvana
   Immediately before physical death, an Arahant's
   consciousness passes out of conditioned existence and enters into
   Nirvana, and will not reenter conditioned existence.

progress of insight
   The sequence of insights leading up to
   enlightenment and immediately after enlightenment.

psychedelic
   Of alterations in consciousness or perceptions. From the
   Greek psyche (mind) + delos (clear). Psychedelic drugs have an effect of
   creating a sense that the mind is seeing clearer and consciousness is
   expanded. In larger doses, they have an increased effect of distorting
   perceptions, confusing the mind and causing hallucinations. In some
   cases, psychedelic drugs have induced a profound examination of the
   present moment, and have resulted in *deep insight.*

Saint
   A person considered to be holy and worthy of veneration. As used
   in this book, it is someone who has purified their consciousness of
   defilements and is enlightened.

Sakadagami
   Also known as a Once-returner. Someone who has reached the
   second level of enlightenment. Traditionally, a *Sakadagami* is said
   to have reduced the defilements of mind of lust and aversion. A
   *Sakadagami* has greater clarity of mind and a deeper intuitive wisdom
   than a stream-winner.

shaktipat
   The transmission of psychic energy from teacher to student
   that results in a variety of phenomenon, such as deep trance, visions,
   energy sensations and uncontrollable body motions.

Samatha
   Pure concentration meditation practice. *Samatha* meditation
   is essentially a form of self-hypnosis. The mind is focused on a fixed
   object which seems more solid, real and unchanging as concentration
   deepens. As one is able to focus the mind precisely on the object
   of concentration with less wavering to other objects or thoughts,
   specific levels of concentration called *jhanas* are attained. Any
   sense object—sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or thought—can be used as
   an object of *samatha* meditation. Sensations of breathing are
   frequently used as objects of meditation in *vipassana* practice
   because the breath is a changing object. *Samatha* is an essential
   component to *vipassana* and is developed first. True *vipassana*
   practice begins to develop when the level of *nama-rupa* is
   reached. *Vipassana* deconditions the hypnotic state of mind which
   results in an illusory view of reality. One of the reasons that
   vipassana meditation is so difficult is that *samatha* is constantly
   being destroyed by *vipassana.*

Self
   In the Hindu tradition, the true self is the *atta* which is an
   unchanging aspect of the consciousness of God. The objective of Hindu
   practice is to come to the full realization that the *atta* is the
   true self and the relinquishment of any sense that you are anything else
   but the *atta.* Most Westerners do not have this concept of *atta*,
   but because of unawareness, there is a natural tendency to view the
   self as being in control and unchanging. As *vipassana* meditation
   develops, the meditator comes to see that the self is the result of
   cause and effect processes, and has no solid continuous existence.

sotapanna
   A Stream-winner.

sutta
   Lit. a seat. The Buddha would sit and give a discourse, and after
   it, a senior monk would compose a chant which was a summary of what the
   Buddha had said. Monks and nuns still spend a considerable amount of
   time reciting these chants in groups. The chanting is a combination of
   concentration meditation and education

Stream-winner
   One who has attained the first level of enlightenment.
   Defilements uprooted are: Doubt that the Eightfold Path will lead to
   total purification of the mind, belief that rites and rituals will
   result in enlightenment, and belief in the usual sense of self. In this
   book I define a *Stream-winner* as one who has permanently accessed
   the first stratum of the unconscious mind.

Theravada
   Thera means elder, and vada is the way of, so it is literally
   the way of the elders. The Theravadans regard the Pali record of the
   Buddha's discourses, which were written two hundred years after the
   Buddha, and the Pali Commentaries, compiled by Buddhaghosa a thousand
   years after the time of the Buddha, as the only valid version of the
   Buddha's teaching. The roots of the Theravada tradition comes from King
   Asoka who sponsored the writing of the Buddha's discourses in Pali.
   Since Asoka richly patronized Buddhist monasteries, it became necessary
   to clearly define which traditions were true Buddhists and which were
   false. The Theravada tradition existed along with other traditions of
   Buddhism in India for a thousand years, but all forms of Buddhism were
   eliminated in India by Muslim invaders. However, King Asoka's son, who
   was a monk and his daughter, who was a nun, established the Theravada
   tradition in Sri Lanka which survived and has spread throughout
   Southeast Asia.

*Vipassana*
   To see clearly with great penetration and effort. When
   objects of consciousness are seen with enough penetrating awareness,
   they will be seen as being in a continuous state of change, because
   consciousness is continuously changing.

Zen
   A branch of Mahayana Buddhism which was brought into China by
   Bodhidarma. From China it spread into Korea and Japan. Zen evolved and
   became deeply integrated with Chinese culture before it acquired many of
   the texts and traditions of older forms of Buddhism. A significant
   difference is that Zen monks follow a different set of rules than the
   ones prescribed by the Buddha for monks. The emperors of China placed
   great importance on acquiring more of the Buddha's discourses and
   rewarded people who acquired them. Some of the books of discourses
   acquired have similar titles but different contents than older versions.
